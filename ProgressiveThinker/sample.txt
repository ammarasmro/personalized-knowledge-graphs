title\n\nAutomotive design\n\nAutomotive design is a set of typically non-professional[1] vocations or occupations involved in the development of the appearance, and to some extent the ergonomics, of motor vehicles or more specifically road vehicles.\n\nThis most commonly refers to automobiles but also refers to motorcycles, trucks, buses, coaches, and vans. The functional design and development of a modern motor vehicle is typically done by a large team from many different disciplines included within automotive engineering however design roles are not associated with requirements for Professional or Chartered Engineer qualifications. Automotive design in this context is primarily concerned with developing the visual appearance or aesthetics of the vehicle, though it is also involved in the creation of the product concept. Automotive design is practiced by designers who may have an art background and a degree in industrial design or transportation design.\n\n1 Design elements\n\n1.1 Exterior design 1.2 Interior design 1.3 Color and trim design\n\n1.4 Graphic design\n\n1.5 Computer-aided styling and Class-A development\n\n2 Development process\n\n2.1 Styling development cycle 2.2 Development team\n\n3 Components 4 History\n\n4.1 U.S. 4.2 Europe 4.2.1 France 4.2.2 Great Britain 4.2.3 Germany\n\n4.2.4 Italy\n\n4.2.5 Scandinavia\n\n4.2.6 Czechoslovakia\n\n5 See also 6 References\n\n7 Further reading\n\n8 External links\n\nDesigners at work in 1961. Standing by the scale model\u0027s left front fender is Richard Teague, an automobile designer at American Motors Corporation (AMC)\n\nContents\n\nDesign elements\n\nThe task of the design team is usually split into three main aspects: exterior design, interior design, and color and trim design. Graphic design is also an aspect of automotive design; this is generally shared amongst the design team as the lead designer sees fit. Design focuses not only on the isolated outer shape of automobile parts, but concentrates on the combination of form and function, starting from the vehicle package.\n\nThe aesthetic value will need to correspond to ergonomic functionality and utility features as well. In particular, vehicular electronic components and parts will give more challenges to automotive designers who are required to update on the latest information and knowledge associated with emerging vehicular gadgetry, particularly dashtop mobile devices, like GPS navigation, satellite radio, HD radio, mobile TV, MP3 players, video playback, and smartphone interfaces. Though not all the new vehicular gadgets are to be designated as factory standard items, some of them may be integral to determining the future course of any specific vehicular models.\n\nThe stylist responsible for the design of the exterior of the vehicle develops the proportions, shape, and surfaces of the vehicle. Exterior design is first done by a series of digital or manual drawings. Progressively, drawings that are more detailed are executed and approved by appropriate layers of management. Clay (industrial plasticine) and or digital models are developed from, and along with the drawings. The data from these models are then used to create a full sized mock-up of the final design (body in white). With three- and five-axis CNC milling machines, the clay model is first designed in a computer program and then \"carved\" using the machine and large amounts of clay. Even in times of high-class 3d software and virtual models on power walls, the clay model is still the most important tool to evaluate the design of a car and therefore used throughout the industry.\n\nThe stylist responsible for the design of the vehicle interior develops the proportions, shape, placement, and surfaces for the instrument panel, seats, door trim panels, headliner, pillar trims, etc. Here the emphasis is on ergonomics and the comfort of the passengers. The procedure here is the same as with exterior design (sketch, digital model and clay model).\n\nThe color and trim (or color and materials) designer is responsible for the research, design, and development of all interior and exterior colors and materials used on a vehicle. These include paints, plastics, fabric designs, leather, grains, carpet, headliner, wood trim, and so on. Color, contrast, texture, and pattern must be carefully combined to give the vehicle a unique interior environment experience. Designers work closely with the exterior and interior designers.\n\nDesigners draw inspiration from other design disciplines such as: industrial design, fashion, home furnishing, architecture, and sometimes product design. Specific research is done into global trends to design for projects two to three model years in the future. Trend boards are created from this research in order to keep track of design influences as they relate to the automotive industry. The designer then uses this information to develop themes and concepts that are then further refined and tested on the vehicle models.\n\nA Bertone Birusa concept car on display at an International Car Show. In the Background are some concept sketches\n\nDraft of OScar design proposal\n\nA futuristic original sketch for Ferrari Modulo 512-S by Paul Martin in 1967. There are already many features of the final concept, including the reduced height, wheels coved for low drag and the characteristic entry system.\n\nExterior design\n\nInterior design\n\nColor and trim design\n\nThe design team also develops graphics for items such as: badges, decals, dials, switches, kick or tread strips, liveries.\n\nThe sketches and rendering are transformed into 3D Digital surface modelling and rendering for real-time evaluation with Math data in initial stages. During the development process succeeding phases will require the 3D model fully developed to meet the aesthetic requirements of a designer and well as all engineering and manufacturing requirements. The fully developed CAS digital model will be re-developed for manufacturing meeting the Class-A surface standards that involves both technical as well as aesthetics. This data will be further developed by Product Engineering team. These modelers usually have a background in Industrial design or sometimes tooling engineering in case of some Class-A modelers. Autodesk Alias and ICEM Surf are the two most widely used software tools for Class-A development.\n\nSeveral manufacturers have slightly varied development cycles for designing an Automobile, but in practice these are the following.\n\nDesign and User Research Concept Development sketching Class A surfaces\n\nClay modeling\n\nInterior Buck Model\n\nVehicle ergonomics\n\nClass A surfaces\n\nColour and Trim\n\nVehicle Graphics\n\nThe design process occurs concurrently with other product Engineers who will be engineering the styling data for meeting performance, manufacturing and safety regulations. From mid-phase, back and forth interactions between the designers and product engineers culminates into a finished product be manufacturing ready.\n\nApart from this the Engineering team parallelly works in the following areas. Product Engineering (Body In White Sheetmetal Design and Plastic engineering), NVH Development team, Prototype development, Powertrain engineering, Physical Vehicle validation, Tool and Die development and Manufacturing process design.\n\nThe styling team for a specific model consists of a chief designer and an Exterior as well as interior designer. In some cases all three roles are done by one designer. Several junior designers are involved in the development process as well who make specific contributions all overseen by the chief designer. Apart from this the Color and trim designer works closely with other designers. The Clay model team and Digital model team works closely with the styling team all located within the studio. Apart from this there would be studio head, studio managers and prototype engineers who would work across all teams in the studio. The total team size for developing a full sedan usually ranges from 25 to 40 members and the development time lasts for more than 24 months till signed-off for tooling and production. Thereafter a smaller team would be working until vehicle launch.\n\nGraphic design\n\nComputer-aided styling and Class-A development\n\nDevelopment process\n\nA 1986 Ford Taurus clay model on display in Ford Detroit Styling Studio\n\nStyling development cycle\n\nDevelopment team\n\nComponents\n\nIntegration of an automobile involves fitting together separate parts to form a monocoque body or units and mounting these onto a frame, the chassis.\n\nAn automobile chassis basically comprises the following:[2]\n\n1. The body shell, which forms the skeleton of the vehicle.\n\n2. The engine, is the power unit of the vehicle; which in the past has been in large part, the internal combustion engine. 3. Transmission system, which aids in transferring the drive from the engine to the wheels. Its main components are the clutch, gearbox, final drive, and differential.\n\n4. Suspension system, which is used to connect the wheels to the body or chassis frame. 5. Steering\n\n6. Brakes\n\n7. Electrical equipment\n\nThe chassis is complete in itself as a road vehicle. It can drive and control itself just as in case of a complete car and therefore, in many motor works, the chassis is usually tested on the road before the complete body of the vehicle is attached as the chassis alone can behave as the propulsion means.[3]\n\nIn the United States, automotive design reached a turning point in the 1920\u0027s when the American national automobile market began reaching saturation. To maintain unit sales, General Motors head Alfred P. Sloan Jr. suggested annual model-year design changes to convince car owners that they needed to buy a new replacement each year, an idea borrowed from the bicycle industry (though Sloan usually gets the credit, or blame).[4] Critics called his strategy planned obsolescence. Sloan preferred the term \"dynamic obsolescence\". This strategy had far-reaching effects on the auto business, the field of product design, and eventually the American economy.\n\nThe smaller automakers could not maintain the pace and expense of yearly restyling. Henry Ford did not like the model-year change because he clung to an engineer\u0027s notions of simplicity, economics of scale, and design integrity. GM surpassed Ford\u0027s sales in 1931, and became the dominant company in the industry thereafter. The frequent design changes also made it necessary to use a body-on- frame rather than the lighter but less adaptable monocoque design used by most European automakers.\n\nSome U.S. designers include Gordon Buehrig, who was responsible for the Auburn 851, as well as the Cord 810 and 812 (hence also the Hupmobile Skylark and the Graham Hollywood).\n\nIn the 1930s, Chrysler\u0027s innovations with aerodynamics helped launch the Chrysler Airflow in 1934, which was revolutionary and radical compared to the contemporary vehicles. However, inadequate consumer acceptance of the advanced appearance of the cars forced a re-design of succeeding models of the Airflow. This marketing experience made the entire industry take note of the high risks involved in incorporating major design advancements into their production cars.\n\nA major influence on American auto styling and marketing was Harley Earl,[5] who brought the tailfin and other aeronautical design references to auto design starting with the rear fenders of the 1948 Cadillac. Another notable designer was Chrysler group\u0027s designer Virgil Exner, who developed the Forward look design in the mid-1950s. Exner is also\n\nHistory\n\nU.S.\n\nAn early example of Sloan\u0027s work, 1939 LaSalle\n\nAn early example of the Forward look design, 1956 Plymouth Fury\n\nA design that was imitated by other automakers, Jeep Cherokee (XJ)\n\ncredited with using wind tunnel testing to justify incorporating tailfins, thus moving the company away from boxy-looking cars into more aerodynamic and futuristic designs. Raymond Loewy was responsible for a number of Studebaker vehicles, including the Starlight (including the bullet-nose).\n\nStarting in the 1960s, Richard A. Teague, who spent most of his career with American Motors Corporation (AMC), originated the concept of using interchangeable body panels so as to create a wide array of different vehicles using the same stampings, starting with the AMC Cavalier.[6] Teague was responsible for unique automotive designs such as the two-seat AMC AMX muscle car, the subcompact Gremlin, the Pacer, and Matador coupe, as well as the original and market segment-creating, Jeep Cherokee (introduced in 1983, and built to 2001 in the U.S. and through 2005 in China).[7][8]\n\nAdditionally during the 1960s, Ford\u0027s first generation Ford Mustang and Thunderbird marked another era leading into new market segments from Detroit. The Ford Mustang achieved record sales in its first year of production and established the pony car segment.\n\nPersonal injury litigation has had an efect on the design and appearance of the car in the 20th century.[9]\n\nUntil World War I, most of the automakers were concerned with mechanical reliability rather than its external appearance. Later, luxury and aesthetics became a demand and also an effective marketing tool. Designs from each nation with its own strong cultural identity, reflected in their exterior and interior designs. World War II slowed the progress, but after the early-1950s, Italian designers set the trend and remained the driving force until the early part of the 1980s.\n\nIn France notable designs came from Bugatti and Avions Voisin. Of the mass selling cars Citroën, launched their vehicles with innovative designs and engineering and mostly aided by the styling of Flaminio Bertoni as evident from Citroën DS.[10] After World War II, with the disappearance of the coach building industry,[11] French automakers (except Citroën) followed British and other popular trends until they gained financial stability. During the 1980s, manufactures like Renault cultivated their own strong design identities with designers like Patrick Le Quement. Peugeot, which was dependent on Pininfarina since early post-war period, later established its own brand identity from the 1980s onwards. Its other company, Citroën, still retains its distinctive French innovations for its designs.\n\nGreat Britain was Europe\u0027s leading manufacturer of automobiles until the late-1960s. During that era there were more British-based automakers than in the rest of Europe combined. The British automobile industry catered to all segments ranging from compact, budget, sports, utility, and luxury-type cars. Car design in Britain was markedly different from other European designs largely because British designers were not influenced by other European art or design movements, as well as the British clay modelers used a diferent sweep set.\n\nBritish cars until World War II were sold in most of the British colonies. Innovations in vehicle packaging and chassis engineering combined with global familiarity with British designs meant vehicles were acceptable to public tastes at that time. British skilled resources like panel beaters, die machinists, and clay modelers were also available also partly due their involvement with motorsport industry.\n\nEurope\n\nAn early radical French Voisin C26\n\nFrance\n\nCitroën DS\n\nGreat Britain\n\n1981 Ford Sierra with \"jelly-mould\" or \"aero look\" (low CD) styling was advanced for its time\n\nStill during the 1960s, British manufacturers sought professional help from the Italians, such as Giovanni Michelotti, Ercole Spada, and Pininfarina. Notable British contributions to automobile designs were Morris Mini by Alec Issigonis, several Jaguar Cars by Sir William Lyons and Malcolm Sayer,[12] Aston Martin DB Series, and several cars from Triumph and MG. Ford Europe based in Great Britain, is notable for the Ford Sierra line, a creation of Uwe Bahnsen, Robert Lutz, and Patrick le Quément. Other British designers were William Towns for Aston Martin cars and David Bache for Land Rover and Range Rover vehicles.\n\nGermany is often considered the birthplace of industrial design with Bauhaus School of Design. However, the Nazi regime closed down the design school. Ferdinand Porsche and his family played a significant role in German design. Mercedes Benz passenger cars were also in luxury segment and played more importance to aesthetics. After the 1980s, German design evolved into a distinctive Teutonic style often to complement their high engineered cars suited to Autobahns. The early German design clues of present-day owes some part to Italian designers like Giovanni Michelotti, Ercole Spada, Bruno Sacco, and Giorgetto Giugiaro. During the mid- and late-20th century one of the most influential coach builder/designer in Germany was Karmann.\n\nGerman designs started gaining popularity after the 1980s, notable after the formation of Audi. Volkswagen, which was dependent on Marcello Gandini, Giorgetto Giugiaro, and Karmann, later formed the contemporary design language along with Audi. BMW entered the automobile design with a sporty-looking everyday sedans using Giovanni Michelotti. These models were later enhanced by Ercole Spada into the 1980s, and Klaus Luthe until the mid-1990s. The American born designer Chris Bangle was hired by BMW in the late-1990s to re-define the brand. Bangle incorporated new single press technology for compound curves to add controversial styling elements to his designs.\n\nThe Porsche family contribution were instrumental in the evolution of Porsche cars, while the Italian designer Bruno Sacco helped create various Mercedes Models from the 1960s to the 1990s.\n\nIn Italy, companies like Fiat and Alfa Romeo played a major role in car design. Many coach builders were dependent on these two major manufacturers. Italian manufacturers had a large presence in motorsports leading to several sport car manufacturers like Ferrari, Lancia, Lamborghini, Maserati, etc. During the late-1950s, Italian automobile designs gained global popularity coinciding with the modern fashion and architecture at that time around the world. Various design and technical schools in Turin turned out designers in large scale. By the late-1960s almost all Italian coach builders transformed into design studios catering to automakers around the world. The trend continued in the 1990s, when the Japanese and Korean manufacturers sourced designs from these styling studios. One example is Pininfarina.\n\nItalian designers whose designs services were sought globally are Giovanni Michelotti, Ercole Spada, Bruno Sacco, Marcello Gandini, Giorgetto Giugiaro, and Walter de Silva.\n\nSweden had Volvo and Saab as domestic automakers, and the nation\u0027s northern location required that cars needed to withstand Nordic climate conditions. The Scandinavian design elements are known for their minimalism and simplicity. One of the early original Scandinavian designs was the Saab 92001 by Sixten Sason and Gunnar Ljungström.\n\nGermany\n\nThe 1972 BMW 2002 by Giovanni Michelotti\n\nItaly\n\nFerrari Testarossa from Pininfarina Studios by Leonardo Fioravanti\n\nScandinavia\n\nPrior to World War II and until the early-1990s, Czechoslovakia had strong presence in the automotive industry with manufacturers like Skoda, Jawa, Tatra, CZ, Praga, and Zetor. Czech automobiles were generally known for their originality in mechanical simplicity and designs were remarkably Bohemian as evident from Tatra cars and Jawa motorcycles. During the Communist regime, design started falling back and ultimately the domestic automakers ended up as subsidiaries of EU-based companies.\n\nAutomotive aerodynamics Automotive Engineering\n\nAutomotive Engineering industrial design\n\nAlternative propulsion Automobile layout Automotive design terminology Coachbuilder Car body style Car classification Car model\n\nCar safety Cab forward Computer-aided\n\nConcept vehicle Dashtop mobile List of automotive designers Ecodesign Facelift (automobile) Virtual tuning H-point Industrial Design Mass production Packages Platform Ponton styling Pre-production car Prototype\n\nSolid freeform fabrication Three-box design Wind tunnel\n\n1.

The functional design and development of a modern motor vehicle is typically done by a large team from many different disciplines included within automotive engineering however design roles are not associated with requirements for Professional or Chartered Engineer qualifications. Automotive design in this context is primarily concerned with developing the visual appearance or aesthetics of the vehicle, though it is also involved in the creation of the product concept. Automotive design is practiced by designers who may have an art background and a degree in industrial design or transportation design.\n\n1 Design elements\n\n1.1 Exterior design 1.2 Interior design 1.3 Color and trim design\n\n1.4 Graphic design\n\n1.5 Computer-aided styling and Class-A development\n\n2 Development process\n\n2.1 Styling development cycle 2.2 Development team\n\n3 Components 4 History\n\n4.1 U.S. 4.2 Europe 4.2.1 France 4.2.2 Great Britain 4.2.3 Germany\n\n4.2.4 Italy\n\n4.2.5 Scandinavia\n\n4.2.6 Czechoslovakia\n\n5 See also 6 References\n\n7 Further reading\n\n8 External links\n\nDesigners at work in 1961.

Graphic design is also an aspect of automotive design; this is generally shared amongst the design team as the lead designer sees fit. Design focuses not only on the isolated outer shape of automobile parts, but concentrates on the combination of form and function, starting from the vehicle package.\n\nThe aesthetic value will need to correspond to ergonomic functionality and utility features as well. In particular, vehicular electronic components and parts will give more challenges to automotive designers who are required to update on the latest information and knowledge associated with emerging vehicular gadgetry, particularly dashtop mobile devices, like GPS navigation, satellite radio, HD radio, mobile TV, MP3 players, video playback, and smartphone interfaces. Though not all the new vehicular gadgets are to be designated as factory standard items, some of them may be integral to determining the future course of any specific vehicular models.\n\nThe stylist responsible for the design of the exterior of the vehicle develops the proportions, shape, and surfaces of the vehicle. Exterior design is first done by a series of digital or manual drawings. Progressively, drawings that are more detailed are executed and approved by appropriate layers of management. Clay (industrial plasticine) and or digital models are developed from, and along with the drawings. The data from these models are then used to create a full sized mock-up of the final design (body in white). With three- and five-axis CNC milling machines, the clay model is first designed in a computer program and then \"carved\" using the machine and large amounts of clay. Even in times of high-class 3d software and virtual models on power walls, the clay model is still the most important tool to evaluate the design of a car and therefore used throughout the industry.\n\nThe stylist responsible for the design of the vehicle interior develops the proportions, shape, placement, and surfaces for the instrument panel, seats, door trim panels, headliner, pillar trims, etc. Here the emphasis is on ergonomics and the comfort of the passengers. The procedure here is the same as with exterior design (sketch, digital model and clay model).\n\nThe color and trim (or color and materials) designer is responsible for the research, design, and development of all interior and exterior colors and materials used on a vehicle. These include paints, plastics, fabric designs, leather, grains, carpet, headliner, wood trim, and so on. Color, contrast, texture, and pattern must be carefully combined to give the vehicle a unique interior environment experience. Designers work closely with the exterior and interior designers.\n\nDesigners draw inspiration from other design disciplines such as: industrial design, fashion, home furnishing, architecture, and sometimes product design. Specific research is done into global trends to design for projects two to three model years in the future. Trend boards are created from this research in order to keep track of design influences as they relate to the automotive industry. The designer then uses this information to develop themes and concepts that are then further refined and tested on the vehicle models.\n\nA Bertone Birusa concept car on display at an International Car Show. In the Background are some concept sketches\n\nDraft of OScar design proposal\n\nA futuristic original sketch for Ferrari Modulo 512-S by Paul Martin in 1967. There are already many features of the final concept, including the reduced height, wheels coved for low drag and the characteristic entry system.\n\nExterior design\n\nInterior design\n\nColor and trim design\n\nThe design team also develops graphics for items such as: badges, decals, dials, switches, kick or tread strips, liveries.\n\nThe sketches and rendering are transformed into 3D Digital surface modelling and rendering for real-time evaluation with Math data in initial stages. During the development process succeeding phases will require the 3D model fully developed to meet the aesthetic requirements of a designer and well as all engineering and manufacturing requirements. The fully developed CAS digital model will be re-developed for manufacturing meeting the Class-A surface standards that involves both technical as well as aesthetics. This data will be further developed by Product Engineering team. These modelers usually have a background in Industrial design or sometimes tooling engineering in case of some Class-A modelers. Autodesk Alias and ICEM Surf are the two most widely used software tools for Class-A development.\n\nSeveral manufacturers have slightly varied development cycles for designing an Automobile, but in practice these are the following.\n\nDesign and User Research Concept Development sketching Class A surfaces\n\nClay modeling\n\nInterior Buck Model\n\nVehicle ergonomics\n\nClass A surfaces\n\nColour and Trim\n\nVehicle Graphics\n\nThe design process occurs concurrently with other product Engineers who will be engineering the styling data for meeting performance, manufacturing and safety regulations. From mid-phase, back and forth interactions between the designers and product engineers culminates into a finished product be manufacturing ready.\n\nApart from this the Engineering team parallelly works in the following areas. Product Engineering (Body In White Sheetmetal Design and Plastic engineering), NVH Development team, Prototype development, Powertrain engineering, Physical Vehicle validation, Tool and Die development and Manufacturing process design.\n\nThe styling team for a specific model consists of a chief designer and an Exterior as well as interior designer. In some cases all three roles are done by one designer. Several junior designers are involved in the development process as well who make specific contributions all overseen by the chief designer. Apart from this the Color and trim designer works closely with other designers. The Clay model team and Digital model team works closely with the styling team all located within the studio. Apart from this there would be studio head, studio managers and prototype engineers who would work across all teams in the studio. The total team size for developing a full sedan usually ranges from 25 to 40 members and the development time lasts for more than 24 months till signed-off for tooling and production. Thereafter a smaller team would be working until vehicle launch.\n\nGraphic design\n\nComputer-aided styling and Class-A development\n\nDevelopment process\n\nA 1986 Ford Taurus clay model on display in Ford Detroit Styling Studio\n\nStyling development cycle\n\nDevelopment team\n\nComponents\n\nIntegration of an automobile involves fitting together separate parts to form a monocoque body or units and mounting these onto a frame, the chassis.\n\nAn automobile chassis basically comprises the following:[2]\n\n1. The body shell, which forms the skeleton of the vehicle.\n\n2. The engine, is the power unit of the vehicle; which in the past has been in large part, the internal combustion engine. 3. Transmission system, which aids in transferring the drive from the engine to the wheels. Its main components are the clutch, gearbox, final drive, and differential.\n\n4. Suspension system, which is used to connect the wheels to the body or chassis frame. 5. Steering\n\n6. Brakes\n\n7. Electrical equipment\n\nThe chassis is complete in itself as a road vehicle. It can drive and control itself just as in case of a complete car and therefore, in many motor works, the chassis is usually tested on the road before the complete body of the vehicle is attached as the chassis alone can behave as the propulsion means.[3]\n\nIn the United States, automotive design reached a turning point in the 1920\u0027s when the American national automobile market began reaching saturation. To maintain unit sales, General Motors head Alfred P. Sloan Jr. suggested annual model-year design changes to convince car owners that they needed to buy a new replacement each year, an idea borrowed from the bicycle industry (though Sloan usually gets the credit, or blame).[4] Critics called his strategy planned obsolescence. Sloan preferred the term \"dynamic obsolescence\". This strategy had far-reaching effects on the auto business, the field of product design, and eventually the American economy.\n\nThe smaller automakers could not maintain the pace and expense of yearly restyling. Henry Ford did not like the model-year change because he clung to an engineer\u0027s notions of simplicity, economics of scale, and design integrity. GM surpassed Ford\u0027s sales in 1931, and became the dominant company in the industry thereafter. The frequent design changes also made it necessary to use a body-on- frame rather than the lighter but less adaptable monocoque design used by most European automakers.\n\nSome U.S. designers include Gordon Buehrig, who was responsible for the Auburn 851, as well as the Cord 810 and 812 (hence also the Hupmobile Skylark and the Graham Hollywood).\n\nIn the 1930s, Chrysler\u0027s innovations with aerodynamics helped launch the Chrysler Airflow in 1934, which was revolutionary and radical compared to the contemporary vehicles. However, inadequate consumer acceptance of the advanced appearance of the cars forced a re-design of succeeding models of the Airflow. This marketing experience made the entire industry take note of the high risks involved in incorporating major design advancements into their production cars.\n\nA major influence on American auto styling and marketing was Harley Earl,[5] who brought the tailfin and other aeronautical design references to auto design starting with the rear fenders of the 1948 Cadillac. Another notable designer was Chrysler group\u0027s designer Virgil Exner, who developed the Forward look design in the mid-1950s. Exner is also\n\nHistory\n\nU.S.\n\nAn early example of Sloan\u0027s work, 1939 LaSalle\n\nAn early example of the Forward look design, 1956 Plymouth Fury\n\nA design that was imitated by other automakers, Jeep Cherokee (XJ)\n\ncredited with using wind tunnel testing to justify incorporating tailfins, thus moving the company away from boxy-looking cars into more aerodynamic and futuristic designs. Raymond Loewy was responsible for a number of Studebaker vehicles, including the Starlight (including the bullet-nose).\n\nStarting in the 1960s, Richard A. Teague, who spent most of his career with American Motors Corporation (AMC), originated the concept of using interchangeable body panels so as to create a wide array of different vehicles using the same stampings, starting with the AMC Cavalier.[6] Teague was responsible for unique automotive designs such as the two-seat AMC AMX muscle car, the subcompact Gremlin, the Pacer, and Matador coupe, as well as the original and market segment-creating, Jeep Cherokee (introduced in 1983, and built to 2001 in the U.S. and through 2005 in China).[7][8]\n\nAdditionally during the 1960s, Ford\u0027s first generation Ford Mustang and Thunderbird marked another era leading into new market segments from Detroit. The Ford Mustang achieved record sales in its first year of production and established the pony car segment.\n\nPersonal injury litigation has had an efect on the design and appearance of the car in the 20th century.[9]\n\nUntil World War I, most of the automakers were concerned with mechanical reliability rather than its external appearance. Later, luxury and aesthetics became a demand and also an effective marketing tool. Designs from each nation with its own strong cultural identity, reflected in their exterior and interior designs. World War II slowed the progress, but after the early-1950s, Italian designers set the trend and remained the driving force until the early part of the 1980s.\n\nIn France notable designs came from Bugatti and Avions Voisin. Of the mass selling cars Citroën, launched their vehicles with innovative designs and engineering and mostly aided by the styling of Flaminio Bertoni as evident from Citroën DS.[10] After World War II, with the disappearance of the coach building industry,[11] French automakers (except Citroën) followed British and other popular trends until they gained financial stability. During the 1980s, manufactures like Renault cultivated their own strong design identities with designers like Patrick Le Quement. Peugeot, which was dependent on Pininfarina since early post-war period, later established its own brand identity from the 1980s onwards. Its other company, Citroën, still retains its distinctive French innovations for its designs.\n\nGreat Britain was Europe\u0027s leading manufacturer of automobiles until the late-1960s. During that era there were more British-based automakers than in the rest of Europe combined. The British automobile industry catered to all segments ranging from compact, budget, sports, utility, and luxury-type cars. Car design in Britain was markedly different from other European designs largely because British designers were not influenced by other European art or design movements, as well as the British clay modelers used a diferent sweep set.\n\nBritish cars until World War II were sold in most of the British colonies. Innovations in vehicle packaging and chassis engineering combined with global familiarity with British designs meant vehicles were acceptable to public tastes at that time. British skilled resources like panel beaters, die machinists, and clay modelers were also available also partly due their involvement with motorsport industry.\n\nEurope\n\nAn early radical French Voisin C26\n\nFrance\n\nCitroën DS\n\nGreat Britain\n\n1981 Ford Sierra with \"jelly-mould\" or \"aero look\" (low CD) styling was advanced for its time\n\nStill during the 1960s, British manufacturers sought professional help from the Italians, such as Giovanni Michelotti, Ercole Spada, and Pininfarina. Notable British contributions to automobile designs were Morris Mini by Alec Issigonis, several Jaguar Cars by Sir William Lyons and Malcolm Sayer,[12] Aston Martin DB Series, and several cars from Triumph and MG. Ford Europe based in Great Britain, is notable for the Ford Sierra line, a creation of Uwe Bahnsen, Robert Lutz, and Patrick le Quément. Other British designers were William Towns for Aston Martin cars and David Bache for Land Rover and Range Rover vehicles.\n\nGermany is often considered the birthplace of industrial design with Bauhaus School of Design. However, the Nazi regime closed down the design school. Ferdinand Porsche and his family played a significant role in German design. Mercedes Benz passenger cars were also in luxury segment and played more importance to aesthetics. After the 1980s, German design evolved into a distinctive Teutonic style often to complement their high engineered cars suited to Autobahns. The early German design clues of present-day owes some part to Italian designers like Giovanni Michelotti, Ercole Spada, Bruno Sacco, and Giorgetto Giugiaro. During the mid- and late-20th century one of the most influential coach builder/designer in Germany was Karmann.\n\nGerman designs started gaining popularity after the 1980s, notable after the formation of Audi. Volkswagen, which was dependent on Marcello Gandini, Giorgetto Giugiaro, and Karmann, later formed the contemporary design language along with Audi. BMW entered the automobile design with a sporty-looking everyday sedans using Giovanni Michelotti. These models were later enhanced by Ercole Spada into the 1980s, and Klaus Luthe until the mid-1990s. The American born designer Chris Bangle was hired by BMW in the late-1990s to re-define the brand. Bangle incorporated new single press technology for compound curves to add controversial styling elements to his designs.\n\nThe Porsche family contribution were instrumental in the evolution of Porsche cars, while the Italian designer Bruno Sacco helped create various Mercedes Models from the 1960s to the 1990s.\n\nIn Italy, companies like Fiat and Alfa Romeo played a major role in car design. Many coach builders were dependent on these two major manufacturers. Italian manufacturers had a large presence in motorsports leading to several sport car manufacturers like Ferrari, Lancia, Lamborghini, Maserati, etc. During the late-1950s, Italian automobile designs gained global popularity coinciding with the modern fashion and architecture at that time around the world. Various design and technical schools in Turin turned out designers in large scale. By the late-1960s almost all Italian coach builders transformed into design studios catering to automakers around the world. The trend continued in the 1990s, when the Japanese and Korean manufacturers sourced designs from these styling studios. One example is Pininfarina.\n\nItalian designers whose designs services were sought globally are Giovanni Michelotti, Ercole Spada, Bruno Sacco, Marcello Gandini, Giorgetto Giugiaro, and Walter de Silva.\n\nSweden had Volvo and Saab as domestic automakers, and the nation\u0027s northern location required that cars needed to withstand Nordic climate conditions. The Scandinavian design elements are known for their minimalism and simplicity. One of the early original Scandinavian designs was the Saab 92001 by Sixten Sason and Gunnar Ljungström.\n\nGermany\n\nThe 1972 BMW 2002 by Giovanni Michelotti\n\nItaly\n\nFerrari Testarossa from Pininfarina Studios by Leonardo Fioravanti\n\nScandinavia\n\nPrior to World War II and until the early-1990s, Czechoslovakia had strong presence in the automotive industry with manufacturers like Skoda, Jawa, Tatra, CZ, Praga, and Zetor. Czech automobiles were generally known for their originality in mechanical simplicity and designs were remarkably Bohemian as evident from Tatra cars and Jawa motorcycles. During the Communist regime, design started falling back and ultimately the domestic automakers ended up as subsidiaries of EU-based companies.\n\nAutomotive aerodynamics Automotive Engineering\n\nAutomotive Engineering industrial design\n\nAlternative propulsion Automobile layout Automotive design terminology Coachbuilder Car body style Car classification Car model\n\nCar safety Cab forward Computer-aided\n\nConcept vehicle Dashtop mobile List of automotive designers Ecodesign Facelift (automobile) Virtual tuning H-point Industrial Design Mass production Packages Platform Ponton styling Pre-production car Prototype\n\nSolid freeform fabrication Three-box design Wind tunnel\n\n1.

Suspension design for other vehicles is similar, though the process may not be as well established.\n\nThe process entails\n\nSelecting appropriate vehicle level targets Selecting a system architecture\n\nChoosing the location of the \u0027hard points\u0027, or theoretical centres of each ball joint or bushing Selecting the rates of the bushings\n\nAnalysing the loads in the suspension Designing the spring rates\n\nDesigning shock absorber characteristics\n\nDesigning the structure of each component so that it is strong, stiff, light, and cheap Analysing the vehicle dynamics of the resulting design\n\nSince the 1990s the use of multibody simulation and finite element software has made this series of tasks more straightforward.\n\n1 Vehicle level targets 2 System architecture 3 Hardpoints\n\n4 Compliance analysis\n\n5 Loads\n\n6 Detailed design of arms\n\n7 References\n\n7.1 Notes 7.2 Sources\n\nA partial list would include:\n\nMaximum steady state lateral acceleration (in understeer mode) Roll stiffness (degrees per g of lateral acceleration)\n\nRide frequencies\n\nLateral load transfer percentage distribution front to rear Roll moment distribution front to rear\n\nRide heights at various states of load Understeer gradient\n\nTurning circle Ackermann Jounce travel Rebound travel\n\nOnce the overall vehicle targets have been identified they can be used to set targets for the two suspensions. For instance, the overall understeer target can be broken down into contributions from each end using a Bundorf analysis.\n\nContents\n\nVehicle level targets\n\nTypically a vehicle designer is operating within a set of constraints. The suspension architecture selected for each end of the vehicle will have to obey those constraints. For both ends of the car this would include the type of spring, location of the spring, and location of the shock absorbers.\n\nFor the front suspension the following need to be considered\n\nThe type of suspension (MacPherson strut or double wishbone suspension) Type of steering actuator (rack and pinion or recirculating ball)\n\nLocation of the steering actuator in front of, or behind, the wheel centre\n\nFor the rear suspension there are many more possible suspension types, in practice.\n\nThe hardpoints control the static settings and the kinematics of the suspension.\n\nThe static settings are\n\nToe Camber Caster\n\nRoll center height at design load Mechanical (or caster) trail Anti-dive and anti-squat Kingpin Inclination\n\nScrub radius\n\nSpring and shock absorber motion ratios\n\nThe kinematics describe how important characteristics change as the suspension moves, typically in roll or steer. They include\n\nBump Steer Roll Steer Tractive Force Steer\n\nBrake Force Steer\n\nCamber gain in roll\n\nCaster gain in roll\n\nRoll centre height gain\n\nAckermann change with steering angle\n\nTrack gain in roll\n\nThe analysis for these parameters can be done graphically, or by CAD, or by the use of kinematics software.\n\nThe compliance of the bushings, the body, and other parts modify the behaviour of the suspension. In general it is difficult to improve the kinematics of a suspension using the bushings, but one example where it does work is the toe control bush used in Twist-beam rear suspensions. More generally, modern cars suspensions include a Noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) bush. This is designed as the main path for the vibrations and forces that cause road noise and impact noise, and is supposed to be tunable without affecting the kinematics too much.\n\nIn racing cars, bushings tend to be made of harder materials such as brass or delrin.\n\nIn general physical terms, the mass and mechanical hysteresis (damping effect) of solid parts should be accounted for in a dynamic analysis, as well as their elasticity.\n\nSystem architecture\n\nHardpoints\n\nCompliance analysis\n\nOnce the basic geometry is established the loads in each suspension part can be estimated. This can be as simple as deciding what a likely maximum load case is at the contact patch, and then drawing a Free body diagram of each part to work out the forces, or as complex as simulating the behaviour of the suspension over a rough road, and calculating the loads caused. Often loads that have been measured on a similar suspension are used instead - this is the most reliable method.\n\nThe loads and geometry are then used to design the arms and spindle. Inevitably some problems will be found in the course of this that force compromises to be made with the basic geometry of the suspension.\n\nThe Automotive Chassis Engineering Principles - J.

The suspension architecture selected for each end of the vehicle will have to obey those constraints. For both ends of the car this would include the type of spring, location of the spring, and location of the shock absorbers.\n\nFor the front suspension the following need to be considered\n\nThe type of suspension (MacPherson strut or double wishbone suspension) Type of steering actuator (rack and pinion or recirculating ball)\n\nLocation of the steering actuator in front of, or behind, the wheel centre\n\nFor the rear suspension there are many more possible suspension types, in practice.\n\nThe hardpoints control the static settings and the kinematics of the suspension.\n\nThe static settings are\n\nToe Camber Caster\n\nRoll center height at design load Mechanical (or caster) trail Anti-dive and anti-squat Kingpin Inclination\n\nScrub radius\n\nSpring and shock absorber motion ratios\n\nThe kinematics describe how important characteristics change as the suspension moves, typically in roll or steer. They include\n\nBump Steer Roll Steer Tractive Force Steer\n\nBrake Force Steer\n\nCamber gain in roll\n\nCaster gain in roll\n\nRoll centre height gain\n\nAckermann change with steering angle\n\nTrack gain in roll\n\nThe analysis for these parameters can be done graphically, or by CAD, or by the use of kinematics software.\n\nThe compliance of the bushings, the body, and other parts modify the behaviour of the suspension. In general it is difficult to improve the kinematics of a suspension using the bushings, but one example where it does work is the toe control bush used in Twist-beam rear suspensions. More generally, modern cars suspensions include a Noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) bush. This is designed as the main path for the vibrations and forces that cause road noise and impact noise, and is supposed to be tunable without affecting the kinematics too much.\n\nIn racing cars, bushings tend to be made of harder materials such as brass or delrin.\n\nIn general physical terms, the mass and mechanical hysteresis (damping effect) of solid parts should be accounted for in a dynamic analysis, as well as their elasticity.\n\nSystem architecture\n\nHardpoints\n\nCompliance analysis\n\nOnce the basic geometry is established the loads in each suspension part can be estimated. This can be as simple as deciding what a likely maximum load case is at the contact patch, and then drawing a Free body diagram of each part to work out the forces, or as complex as simulating the behaviour of the suspension over a rough road, and calculating the loads caused.

electrical energy to a motor vehicle. It is also known as an SLI battery (starting-lighting-ignition) [1] and its main purpose is to start the engine. Once the engine is running, power for the car\u0027s electrical systems is supplied by the alternator. Typically, starting discharges less than three per cent of the battery capacity. SLI batteries are designed to release a high burst of current and then be quickly recharged. They are not designed for deep discharge, and a full discharge can reduce the battery\u0027s lifespan.[2]\n\nAs well as starting the engine an SLI battery supplies the extra power necessary when the vehicle\u0027s electrical requirements exceed the supply from the charging system. It is also a stabilizer, evening out potentially damaging voltage spikes.[3] While the engine is running, most of the power is provided by the alternator, which includes a voltage regulator to keep the output between 13.5 and 14.5 V.[4] Modern SLI batteries are lead-acid type, using six series-connected cells to provide a nominal 12 volt system (in most passenger vehicles and light trucks), or twelve cells for a 24 volt system in heavy trucks or earth-moving equipment, for example.[5]\n\nBattery electric vehicles are powered by a high-voltage electric vehicle battery, but they usually have an automotive battery as well, so that they can use standard automotive accessories which are designed to run on 12 V.\n\n1 History 2 Design\n\n3 Use and maintenance\n\n4 Environmental impact\n\n5 See also\n\n6 References\n\n7 External links\n\nEarly cars did not have batteries, as their electrical systems were limited. A bell was used instead of an electric horn, headlights were gas-powered, and the engine was started with a crank. Car batteries became widely used around 1920 as cars became equipped with electric starters. The sealed battery, which did not require refilling, was invented in 1971.[6]\n\nThe first starting and charging systems were designed to be 6-volt and positive-ground systems, with the vehicle\u0027s chassis directly connected to the positive battery terminal.[7] Today, all road vehicles have a negative ground system. The negative battery terminal is connected to the car\u0027s chassis.\n\nA typical 12 V, 40 Ah lead-acid car battery\n\nContents\n\nHistory\n\nThe Hudson Motor Car Company was the first to use a standardized battery in 1918 when they started using Battery Council International batteries. BCI is the organization that sets the dimensional standards for batteries.[8]\n\nCars used a 6 V electrical system, and so had 6 V batteries until the mid-1950s. The changeover from 6 to 12 V happened when bigger engines with higher compression ratios required more electrical power to start.[9] Smaller cars, which required less power to start stayed with 6 V longer, for example the Volkswagen Beetle in the mid-1960s and the Citroën 2CV in 1970.\n\nIn the 1990s a 42V electrical system standard was proposed. It was intended to allow more powerful electrically driven accessories, and lighter automobile wiring harnesses. The availability of higher-efficiency motors, new wiring techniques and digital controls, and a focus on hybrid vehicle systems that use high-voltage starter/generators has largely eliminated the push for switching the main automotive voltages.[10]\n\nLow-maintenance or maintenance-free: In the past, batteries required maintenance in the form of electrolyte refills. Modern batteries retain their fluid for the life of the battery. A weakness of these batteries is that they are very intolerant of a deep discharge, for example when the car battery is completely drained by leaving the lights on. This coats the lead plate electrodes with sulfate deposits and can reduce the battery\u0027s lifespan by a third or more. VRLA: also known as absorbed glass mat (AGM) batteries are more tolerant of deep discharge, but are more expensive.[11]\n\nBatteries are typically made of six galvanic cells in a series circuit. Each cell provides 2.1 volts for a total of 12.6 volts at full charge.[12] Each cell of a lead storage battery consists of alternate plates of lead (cathode) and lead coated with lead dioxide (anode) immersed in an electrolyte of sulfuric acid solution.[13] The actual standard cell potential is obtained from the standard reduction potentials. This causes a chemical reaction that releases electrons, allowing them to flow through conductors to produce electricity. As the battery discharges, the acid of the electrolyte reacts with the materials of the plates, changing their surface to lead sulfate. When the battery is recharged, the chemical reaction is reversed: the lead sulfate reforms into lead dioxide. With the plates restored to their original condition, the process may be repeated.\n\nSome vehicles use other starter batteries. the 2010 Porsche 911 GT3 RS has a lithium-ion battery as an option to save weight.[14] Heavy vehicles may have two batteries in series for a 24 V system or may have series-parallel groups of batteries supplying 24 V.[15]\n\nSpecifications:\n\nPhysical format: batteries are grouped by physical size, type and placement of the terminals, and mounting style.[11] Ampere-hours (A·h) is a unit related to the energy storage capacity of the battery. This rating is required by law in Europe.\n\nCranking amperes (CA): the amount of current a battery can provide at 32 °F (0 °C).\n\nCold cranking amperes (CCA) is the amount of current a battery can provide at 0 °F (−18 °C). Modern cars with computer controlled fuel-injected engines take no more than a few seconds to start and CCA figures are less important than they were in the days of carburetors.[16]\n\nHot cranking amperes (HCA) is the amount of current a battery can provide at 80 °F (26.7 °C). The rating is defined as the current a lead-acid battery at that temperature can deliver for 30 seconds and maintain at least 1.2 volts per cell (7.2 volts for a 12-volt battery).\n\nReserve capacity minutes (RCM) is a battery\u0027s ability to sustain a minimum stated electrical load; it is defined as the time (in minutes) that a lead-acid battery at 80 °F (27 °C) will continuously deliver 25 amperes before its voltage drops below 10.5 volts.\n\nBattery Council International group size (BCI) specifies a battery\u0027s physical dimensions, such as length, width, and height. These groups are determined by the organization.\n\nIn the United States there are codes on batteries to help consumers buy a recently produced one. When batteries are stored, they can start losing their charge. A battery made in October 2015 will have a numeric code of 10-5 or an alphanumeric code of K-5. \"A\" is for January, \"B\" is for February, and so on (the letter \"I\" is skipped).[16]\n\nIn South Africa the code on a battery to indicate production date is part of the casing and cast into the bottom left of the cover. The code is Year and week number. (YYWW) eg. 1336 is for week 36 in the year 2013.\n\nDesign\n\nUse and maintenance\n\nHeat is the primary cause of battery failure as it accelerates corrosion inside the battery.[17]\n\nA vehicle with a flat battery can be jump started by the battery of another vehicle or by a portable battery booster, after which a running engine (but running faster than idle speed) will continue to charge the battery.[18]\n\nCorrosion at the battery terminals can prevent a car from starting due to electrical resistance, which can be prevented by the proper application of dielectric grease.[19]\n\nSulfation occurs when the electrodes become coated with a hard layer of lead sulfate which weakens the battery. It occurs when a battery is not fully charged and remains discharged.[20] Sulfated batteries should be charged slowly to prevent damage.[21]\n\nSLI batteries are not designed for deep discharge, and their life is reduced when subjected to this.[22]\n\nCar batteries using lead-antimony plates require regular topping-up with pure water to replace water lost due to electrolysis and evaporation. By changing the alloying element to calcium, more recent designs have reduced the rate of water loss. Modern car batteries have reduced maintenance requirements, and may not provide caps for addition of water to the cells. Such batteries include extra electrolyte above the plates to allow for losses during the battery life.\n\nSome battery manufacturers include a built-in hydrometer to show the state of charge of the battery.\n\nThe primary wear-out mechanism is the shedding of active material from the battery plates, which accumulates at the bottom of the cells and which may eventually short-circuit the plates. This can be substantially reduced by enclosing one set of plates in plastic separator bags, made from a permeable material. This allows the electrolyte and ions to pass through, but keeps the sludge build up from bridging the plates.\n\nBattery recycling of automotive batteries reduces the need for resources required for manufacture of new batteries, diverts toxic lead from landfills, and prevents risk of improper disposal. Once a lead acid battery ceases to hold a charge, it is deemed a used lead acid battery (ULAB), which is classified as hazardous waste under the Basel Convention. The 12-volt car battery is the most recycled product in the world, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In the U.S. alone, about 100 million auto batteries a year are replaced, and 99 percent of them are turned in for recycling.[23] However the recycling may be done incorrectly in unregulated environments. As part of global waste trade ULABs are shipped from industrialized countries to developing countries for disassembly and recuperation of the contents. About 97 per cent of the lead can be recovered. Pure Earth estimates that over 12 million third world people are affected by lead contamination from ULAB processing.[24]\n\nCar adapter Electric vehicle battery\n\nLead-acid battery Rechargeable battery\n\n1.

It is also known as an SLI battery (starting-lighting-ignition) [1] and its main purpose is to start the engine. Once the engine is running, power for the car\u0027s electrical systems is supplied by the alternator. Typically, starting discharges less than three per cent of the battery capacity. SLI batteries are designed to release a high burst of current and then be quickly recharged. They are not designed for deep discharge, and a full discharge can reduce the battery\u0027s lifespan.[2]\n\nAs well as starting the engine an SLI battery supplies the extra power necessary when the vehicle\u0027s electrical requirements exceed the supply from the charging system. It is also a stabilizer, evening out potentially damaging voltage spikes.[3] While the engine is running, most of the power is provided by the alternator, which includes a voltage regulator to keep the output between 13.5 and 14.5 V.[4] Modern SLI batteries are lead-acid type, using six series-connected cells to provide a nominal 12 volt system (in most passenger vehicles and light trucks), or twelve cells for a 24 volt system in heavy trucks or earth-moving equipment, for example.[5]\n\nBattery electric vehicles are powered by a high-voltage electric vehicle battery, but they usually have an automotive battery as well, so that they can use standard automotive accessories which are designed to run on 12 V.\n\n1 History 2 Design\n\n3 Use and maintenance\n\n4 Environmental impact\n\n5 See also\n\n6 References\n\n7 External links\n\nEarly cars did not have batteries, as their electrical systems were limited. A bell was used instead of an electric horn, headlights were gas-powered, and the engine was started with a crank. Car batteries became widely used around 1920 as cars became equipped with electric starters. The sealed battery, which did not require refilling, was invented in 1971.[6]\n\nThe first starting and charging systems were designed to be 6-volt and positive-ground systems, with the vehicle\u0027s chassis directly connected to the positive battery terminal.[7] Today, all road vehicles have a negative ground system. The negative battery terminal is connected to the car\u0027s chassis.\n\nA typical 12 V, 40 Ah lead-acid car battery\n\nContents\n\nHistory\n\nThe Hudson Motor Car Company was the first to use a standardized battery in 1918 when they started using Battery Council International batteries. BCI is the organization that sets the dimensional standards for batteries.[8]\n\nCars used a 6 V electrical system, and so had 6 V batteries until the mid-1950s. The changeover from 6 to 12 V happened when bigger engines with higher compression ratios required more electrical power to start.[9] Smaller cars, which required less power to start stayed with 6 V longer, for example the Volkswagen Beetle in the mid-1960s and the Citroën 2CV in 1970.\n\nIn the 1990s a 42V electrical system standard was proposed. It was intended to allow more powerful electrically driven accessories, and lighter automobile wiring harnesses. The availability of higher-efficiency motors, new wiring techniques and digital controls, and a focus on hybrid vehicle systems that use high-voltage starter/generators has largely eliminated the push for switching the main automotive voltages.[10]\n\nLow-maintenance or maintenance-free: In the past, batteries required maintenance in the form of electrolyte refills. Modern batteries retain their fluid for the life of the battery. A weakness of these batteries is that they are very intolerant of a deep discharge, for example when the car battery is completely drained by leaving the lights on. This coats the lead plate electrodes with sulfate deposits and can reduce the battery\u0027s lifespan by a third or more. VRLA: also known as absorbed glass mat (AGM) batteries are more tolerant of deep discharge, but are more expensive.[11]\n\nBatteries are typically made of six galvanic cells in a series circuit. Each cell provides 2.1 volts for a total of 12.6 volts at full charge.[12] Each cell of a lead storage battery consists of alternate plates of lead (cathode) and lead coated with lead dioxide (anode) immersed in an electrolyte of sulfuric acid solution.[13] The actual standard cell potential is obtained from the standard reduction potentials. This causes a chemical reaction that releases electrons, allowing them to flow through conductors to produce electricity. As the battery discharges, the acid of the electrolyte reacts with the materials of the plates, changing their surface to lead sulfate. When the battery is recharged, the chemical reaction is reversed: the lead sulfate reforms into lead dioxide. With the plates restored to their original condition, the process may be repeated.\n\nSome vehicles use other starter batteries. the 2010 Porsche 911 GT3 RS has a lithium-ion battery as an option to save weight.[14] Heavy vehicles may have two batteries in series for a 24 V system or may have series-parallel groups of batteries supplying 24 V.[15]\n\nSpecifications:\n\nPhysical format: batteries are grouped by physical size, type and placement of the terminals, and mounting style.[11] Ampere-hours (A·h) is a unit related to the energy storage capacity of the battery. This rating is required by law in Europe.\n\nCranking amperes (CA): the amount of current a battery can provide at 32 °F (0 °C).\n\nCold cranking amperes (CCA) is the amount of current a battery can provide at 0 °F (−18 °C). Modern cars with computer controlled fuel-injected engines take no more than a few seconds to start and CCA figures are less important than they were in the days of carburetors.[16]\n\nHot cranking amperes (HCA) is the amount of current a battery can provide at 80 °F (26.7 °C). The rating is defined as the current a lead-acid battery at that temperature can deliver for 30 seconds and maintain at least 1.2 volts per cell (7.2 volts for a 12-volt battery).\n\nReserve capacity minutes (RCM) is a battery\u0027s ability to sustain a minimum stated electrical load; it is defined as the time (in minutes) that a lead-acid battery at 80 °F (27 °C) will continuously deliver 25 amperes before its voltage drops below 10.5 volts.\n\nBattery Council International group size (BCI) specifies a battery\u0027s physical dimensions, such as length, width, and height. These groups are determined by the organization.\n\nIn the United States there are codes on batteries to help consumers buy a recently produced one. When batteries are stored, they can start losing their charge. A battery made in October 2015 will have a numeric code of 10-5 or an alphanumeric code of K-5. \"A\" is for January, \"B\" is for February, and so on (the letter \"I\" is skipped).[16]\n\nIn South Africa the code on a battery to indicate production date is part of the casing and cast into the bottom left of the cover. The code is Year and week number. (YYWW) eg. 1336 is for week 36 in the year 2013.\n\nDesign\n\nUse and maintenance\n\nHeat is the primary cause of battery failure as it accelerates corrosion inside the battery.[17]\n\nA vehicle with a flat battery can be jump started by the battery of another vehicle or by a portable battery booster, after which a running engine (but running faster than idle speed) will continue to charge the battery.[18]\n\nCorrosion at the battery terminals can prevent a car from starting due to electrical resistance, which can be prevented by the proper application of dielectric grease.[19]\n\nSulfation occurs when the electrodes become coated with a hard layer of lead sulfate which weakens the battery. It occurs when a battery is not fully charged and remains discharged.[20] Sulfated batteries should be charged slowly to prevent damage.[21]\n\nSLI batteries are not designed for deep discharge, and their life is reduced when subjected to this.[22]\n\nCar batteries using lead-antimony plates require regular topping-up with pure water to replace water lost due to electrolysis and evaporation. By changing the alloying element to calcium, more recent designs have reduced the rate of water loss. Modern car batteries have reduced maintenance requirements, and may not provide caps for addition of water to the cells. Such batteries include extra electrolyte above the plates to allow for losses during the battery life.\n\nSome battery manufacturers include a built-in hydrometer to show the state of charge of the battery.\n\nThe primary wear-out mechanism is the shedding of active material from the battery plates, which accumulates at the bottom of the cells and which may eventually short-circuit the plates. This can be substantially reduced by enclosing one set of plates in plastic separator bags, made from a permeable material. This allows the electrolyte and ions to pass through, but keeps the sludge build up from bridging the plates.\n\nBattery recycling of automotive batteries reduces the need for resources required for manufacture of new batteries, diverts toxic lead from landfills, and prevents risk of improper disposal. Once a lead acid battery ceases to hold a charge, it is deemed a used lead acid battery (ULAB), which is classified as hazardous waste under the Basel Convention. The 12-volt car battery is the most recycled product in the world, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In the U.S. alone, about 100 million auto batteries a year are replaced, and 99 percent of them are turned in for recycling.[23] However the recycling may be done incorrectly in unregulated environments. As part of global waste trade ULABs are shipped from industrialized countries to developing countries for disassembly and recuperation of the contents. About 97 per cent of the lead can be recovered. Pure Earth estimates that over 12 million third world people are affected by lead contamination from ULAB processing.[24]\n\nCar adapter Electric vehicle battery\n\nLead-acid battery Rechargeable battery\n\n1.

Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods.[2][3] Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car, when German inventor Karl Benz built his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.\n\nCars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort and safety, and controlling a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. Examples include rear reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in car entertainment. Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. This causes air pollution and is also blamed for contributing to climate change and global warming.[4] Vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, began to become commercially available in 2008.\n\nThere are costs and benefits to car use. The costs include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance.[5] The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, health care, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Road traffic accidents are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[6]\n\nThe benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience.[7] The societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the taxes. The ability for people to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[8] It was estimated in 2014 that the number of cars was over 1.25 billion vehicles,[9] up from the 500 million of 1986.[10] The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China, India and other newly industrialized countries.[11]\n\n1 Etymology 2 History\n\nContents\n\n3 Mass production\n\n4 Fuel and propulsion technologies\n\n5 User interface\n\n6 Lighting\n\n7 Weight\n\n8 Seating and body style\n\n9 Safety\n\n10 Costs and benefits\n\n11 Environmental impact\n\n12 Emerging car technologies\n\n12.1 Autonomous car 12.2 Open source development\n\n13 Industry 14 Alternatives 15 Other meanings\n\n16 See also\n\n17 References\n\n18 Further reading\n\n19 External links\n\nThe word\n\ncar\n\nis believed to originate from the Latin word\n\ncarrus\n\nor\n\ncarrum\n\n(\"wheeled vehicle\"), or the Middle English word\n\ncarre\n\n(meaning \"two-wheel cart\", from Old North French). In turn, these originated from the Gaulish word\n\nkarros (a Gallic chariot).[12][13] It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.[14][15] \"Motor car\" is attested from 1895, and is the usual formal name for cars in British English.[3] \"Autocar\" is a variant that is also attested from 1895, but that is now considered archaic. It literally means \"self-propelled car\".[16] The term \"horseless carriage\" was used by some to refer to the first cars at the time that they were being built, and is attested from 1895.[17]\n\nThe word \"automobile\" is a classical compound derived from the Ancient Greek word autós (αὐτός), meaning \"self\", and the Latin word mobilis, meaning \"movable\". It entered the English language from French, and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of Great Britain in 1897.[18] Over time, the word \"automobile\" fell out of favour in Britain, and was replaced by \"motor car\".\n\n\"Automobile\" remains chiefly North American, particularly as a formal or commercial term.[19] An abbreviated form, \"auto\", was formerly a common way to refer to cars in English, but is now considered old-fashioned. The word is still very common as an adjective in American English, usually in compound formations like \"auto industry\" and \"auto mechanic\".[20][21] The abbreviated form is also used in Dutch and German.\n\nThe first working steam-powered vehicle was designed-and most likely built-by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672. It was a 65-cm-long scale-model toy for the Chinese Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger.[7][22][23] It is not known if Verbiest\u0027s model was ever built.[23]\n\nNicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle or car in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle.[24] He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts.[25] His inventions were, however, handicapped by problems with water supply and\n\n[25]\n\nEtymology\n\nHistory\n\nmaintaining steam pressure.[25] In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods, and was of little practical use.\n\nThe development of external combustion engines is detailed as part of the history of the car, but often treated separately from the development of true cars. A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers. Sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865.\n\nIn 1807, Nicéphore Niépce and his brother Claude created what was probably the world\u0027s first internal combustion engine (which they called a Pyréolophore), but they chose to install it in a boat on the river Saone in France.[26] Coincidentally, in 1807 the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed his own \u0027de Rivaz internal combustion engine\u0027 and used it to develop the world\u0027s first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The Niépces\u0027 Pyréolophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.[26] Neither design was very successful, as was the case with others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and Etienne Lenoir with his hippomobile, who each produced vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines.[1]\n\nIn November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouvé demonstrated the first working (three- wheeled) car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris.[27] Although several other German engineers (including Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, and Siegfried Marcus) were working on the problem at about the same time, Karl Benz generally is acknowledged as the inventor of the modern car.[1]\n\nIn 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first Motorwagen was built in 1885 in Mannheim, Germany. He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, Benz \u0026 Cie., which was founded in 1883). Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a model intended for affordability. They also were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products. Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany. In August 1888 Bertha Benz, the wife of Karl Benz, undertook the first road trip by car, to prove the road-worthiness of her husband\u0027s invention.\n\nCugnot\u0027s 1771 fardier à vapeur, as preserved at the Musée des Arts et Métiers, Paris\n\nGustave Trouvé\u0027s tricycle, the first ever electric automobile to be shown in public\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of the modern car\n\nThe original Benz Patent- Motorwagen, first built in 1885 and awarded the patent for the concept\n\nIn 1896, Benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion flat engine, called\n\nboxermotor. During the last years of the nineteenth century, Benz was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and, because of its size, Benz \u0026 Cie., became a joint-stock company. The first motor car in central Europe and one of the first factory-made cars in the world, was produced by Czech company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed to Tatra) in 1897, the Präsident automobil.\n\nDaimler and Maybach founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) in Cannstatt in 1890, and sold their first car in 1892 under the brand name Daimler. It was a horse-drawn stagecoach built by another manufacturer, which they retrofitted with an engine of their design. By 1895 about 30 vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after disputes with their backers. Benz, Maybach and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other\u0027s early work. They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies, Daimler and Maybach were no longer part of DMG. Daimler died in 1900 and later that year, Maybach designed an engine named Daimler-Mercedes that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by Emil Jellinek. This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country. Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine, which generated 35 hp. Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own. Rights to the Daimler brand name were sold to other manufacturers.\n\nKarl Benz proposed co-operation between DMG and Benz \u0026 Cie. when economic conditions began to deteriorate in Germany following the First World War, but the directors of DMG refused to consider it initially. Negotiations between the two companies resumed several years later when these conditions worsened and, in 1924 they signed an Agreement of Mutual Interest, valid until the year 2000. Both enterprises standardized design, production, purchasing, and sales and they advertised or marketed their car models jointly, although keeping their respective brands. On 28 June 1926, Benz \u0026 Cie. and DMG finally merged as the Daimler-Benz company, baptizing all of its cars Mercedes Benz, as a brand honoring the most important model of the DMG cars, the Maybach design later referred to as the 1902 Mercedes-35 hp, along with the Benz name. Karl Benz remained a member of the board of directors of Daimler-Benz until his death in 1929, and at times his two sons also participated in the management of the company.\n\nIn 1890, Émile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began producing vehicles with Daimler engines, and so laid the foundation of the automotive industry in France. In 1891, Auguste Doriot and his Peugeot colleague Louis Rigoulot completed the longest trip by a gasoline-powered vehicle when their self-designed and built Daimler powered Peugeot Type 3 completed 2,100 km (1,300 miles) from Valentigney to Paris and Brest and back again. They were attached to the first Paris-Brest-Paris bicycle race, but finished 6 days after the winning cyclist, Charles Terront.\n\nThe first design for an American car with a gasoline internal combustion engine was made in 1877 by George Selden of Rochester, New York. Selden applied for a patent for a car in 1879, but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built. After a delay of sixteen years and a series of attachments to his application, on 5 November 1895, Selden was granted a United States patent (U.S. Patent 549,160) for a two-stroke car engine, which hindered, more than encouraged, development of cars in the United States. His patent was challenged by Henry Ford and others, and overturned in 191 .\n\nIn 1893, the first running, gasoline-powered American car was built and road-tested by the Duryea brothers of Springfield, Massachusetts. The first public run of the Duryea Motor Wagon took place on 21 September 1893, on Taylor Street in Metro Center Springfield.[28][29] The Studebaker Automobile Company, subsidiary of a long-established wagon and coach manufacturer, started to build cars in 1897[30]:p.66 and commenced sales of electric vehicles in 1902 and gasoline vehicles in 1904.[31]\n\nBertha Benz, the first long distance driver\n\nÉmile Levassor\n\nIn Britain, there had been several attempts to build steam cars with varying degrees of success, with Thomas Rickett even attempting a production run in 1860.[32] Santler from Malvern is recognized by the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain as having made the first gasoline-powered car in the country in 1894,[33] followed by Frederick William Lanchester in 1895, but these were both one-offs.[33] The first production vehicles in Great Britain came from the Daimler Company, a company founded by Harry J. Lawson in 1896, after purchasing the right to use the name of the engines. Lawson\u0027s company made its first car in 1897, and they bore the name Daimler.[33]\n\nIn 1892, German engineer Rudolf Diesel was granted a patent for a \"New Rational Combustion Engine\". In 1897, he built the first diesel engine.[1] Steam-, electric-, and gasoline-powered vehicles competed for decades, with gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s. Although various pistonless rotary engine designs have attempted to compete with the conventional piston and crankshaft design, only Mazda\u0027s version of the Wankel engine has had more than very limited success.\n\nLarge-scale, production-line manufacturing of affordable cars was started by Ransom Olds in 1901 at his Oldsmobile factory in Lansing, Michigan and based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Brunel at the Portsmouth Block Mills, England, in 1802. The assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the U.S. by Thomas Blanchard in 1821, at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts.[34] This concept was greatly expanded by Henry Ford, beginning in 1913 with the world\u0027s first moving assembly line for cars at the Highland Park Ford Plant.\n\nAs a result, Ford\u0027s cars came off the line in fifteen-minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, increasing productivity eightfold, while using less manpower (from 12.5-man-hours to 1 hour 33 minutes).[35] It was so successful, paint became a bottleneck. Only Japan Black would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1913, until fast-drying Duco lacquer was developed in 1926. This is the source of Ford\u0027s apocryphal remark, \"any color as long as it\u0027s black\".[35] In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months\u0027 pay.[35]\n\nFord\u0027s complex safety procedures- especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about-dramatically reduced the rate of injury. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called \"Fordism,\" and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.\n\nArmand Peugeot\n\nMass production\n\nRansom E. Olds founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company (Oldsmobile) in 1897\n\nHenry Ford founded Ford Motor Company in 1903\n\n1927 Ford Model T\n\nIn the automotive industry, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, Citroen was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, had disappeared.[35]\n\nDevelopment of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world\u0027s attention. Key developments included electric ignition and the electric self-starter (both by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 1910-1911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes.\n\nSince the 1920s, nearly all cars have been mass-produced to meet market needs, so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design. It was Alfred P. Sloan who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company, called the General Motors Companion Make Program, so that buyers could \"move up\" as their fortunes improved.\n\nReflecting the rapid pace of change, makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1930s, LaSalles, sold by Cadillac, used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile; in the 1950s, Chevrolet shared hood, doors, roof, and windows with Pontiac; by the 1990s, corporate powertrains and shared platforms (with interchangeable brakes, suspension, and other parts) were common. Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as Apperson, Cole, Dorris, Haynes, or Premier, could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the Great Depression, by 1940, only 17 of those were left.[35]\n\nIn Europe, much the same would happen. Morris set up its production line at Cowley in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford\u0027s practice of vertical integration, buying Hotchkiss (engines), Wrigley (gearboxes), and Osberton (radiators), for instance, as well as competitors, such as Wolseley: in 1925, Morris had 41% of total British car production. Most British small-car assemblers, from Abbey to Xtra, had gone under. Citroen did the same in France, coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as Renault\u0027s 10CV and Peugeot\u0027s 5CV, they produced 550,000 cars in 1925, and Mors, Hurtu, and others could not compete.[35] Germany\u0027s first mass-manufactured car, the Opel 4PS Laubfrosch (Tree Frog), came off the line at Russelsheim in 1924, soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany, with 37.5% of the market.[35]\n\nIn Japan, car production was very limited before World War II. Only a handful of companines were producing vehicles in limited numbers, and these were small, three-wheeled for commercial uses, like Daihatsu, or were the result of partnering with European companies, like Isuzu building the Wolseley A-9 in 1922. Mitsubishi was also partnered with Fiat and built the Mitsubishi Model A based on a Fiat vehicle. Toyota, Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, and Honda began as companies producing non-automotive products before the war, switching to car production during the 1950s. Kiichiro Toyoda\u0027s decision to take Toyoda Loom Works into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become Toyota Motor Corporation, the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Subaru, meanwhile, was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as Fuji Heavy Industries, as a result of having been broken up under keiretsu legislation.\n\nMost cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the deflagration (rather than detonation) combustion of hydrocarbon fossil fuels, mostly gasoline (petrol) and diesel, as well as some Autogas and CNG. Hydrocarbon fuels cause air pollution and contribute to climate change and global warming.[4] Rapidly increasing oil prices, concerns about oil\n\nKiichiro Toyoda, president of the Toyota Motor Corporation 1941-1950\n\nMass production at a Toyota plant in the 1950s\n\nFuel and propulsion technologies\n\ndependence, tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars. Efforts to improve or replace existing technologies include the development of hybrid vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles. Vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries. Cars for racing or speed records have sometimes employed jet or rocket engines, but these are impractical for common use.\n\nOil consumption in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries has been abundantly pushed by car growth; the 1985-2003 oil glut even fuelled the sales of low-economy vehicles in OECD countries. The BRIC countries are adding to this consumption; in December 2009 China was briefly the largest car market.[36]\n\nCars are equipped with controls used for driving, passenger comfort and safety, normally operated by a combination of the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 2000s-era cars. These controls include a steering wheel, pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car\u0027s speed (and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch pedal), a shift lever or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights, ventilation and other functions. Modern cars\u0027 controls are now standardised, such as the location for the accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for example the electric car and the integration of mobile communications.\n\nSince the car was first invented, its controls have become fewer and simpler through automation. For example, all cars once had a manual controls for the choke valve, clutch, ignition timing, and a crank instead of an electric starter. However new controls have also been added to vehicles, making them more complex. Examples include air conditioning, navigation systems, and in car entertainment. Another trend is the replacement of physical knob and switches for secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as BMW\u0027s iDrive and Ford\u0027s MyFord Touch. Another change is that while early cars\u0027 pedals were physically linked to the brake mechanism and throttle, in the 2010s, cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with electronic controls.\n\nCars are typically fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, which are used to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on the ceiling of the car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.\n\nThe Nissan Leaf is an all-electric car launched in December 2010\n\nUser interface\n\nIn the Ford Model T the left-side hand lever sets the rear wheel parking brakes and puts the transmission in neutral. The lever to the right controls the throttle. The lever on the left of the steering column is for ignition timing. The left foot pedal changes the two forward gears while the centre pedal controls reverse. The right pedal is the brake.\n\nLighting\n\nLED daytime running lights on an Audi A4\n\nWeight\n\nIn the United States, \"from 1975 to 1980, average [car] weight dropped from 1,842 to 1,464 kg (4,060 to 3,228 lb), likely in response to rising gasoline prices\" and new fuel efficiency standards.[38] The average new car weighed 1,461 kg (3,221 lb) in 1987 but 1,818 kg (4,009 lb) in 2010, due to modern steel safety cages, anti-lock brakes, airbags, and \"more-powerful-if more-efficient-engines.\"[39] Heavier cars are safer for the driver, from an accident perspective, but more dangerous for other vehicles and road users.[39] The weight of a car influences fuel consumption and performance, with more weight resulting in increased fuel consumption and decreased performance. The SmartFortwo, a small city car, weighs 750-795 kg (1,655-1,755 lb). Heavier cars include full-size cars, SUVs and extended-length SUVs like the Suburban.\n\nAccording to research conducted by Julian Allwood of the University of Cambridge, global energy use could be heavily reduced by using lighter cars, and an average weight of 500 kg (1,100 lb) has been said to be well achievable.[40] In some competitions such as the Shell Eco Marathon, average car weights of 45 kg (99 lb) have also been achieved.[41][42] These cars are only single-seaters (still falling within the definition of a car, although 4-seater cars are more common), but they nevertheless demonstrate the amount by which car weights could still be reduced, and the subsequent lower fuel use (i.e. up to a fuel use of 2560 km/l).[43]\n\nMost cars are designed to carry multiple occupants, often with four or five seats.\n\nCars with five seats typically seat two passengers in the front and three in the rear. Full-size cars and large sport utility vehicles can often carry six, seven, or more occupants depending on the arrangement of the seats. On the other hand, sports cars are most often designed with only two seats. The differing needs for passenger capacity and their luggage or cargo space has resulted in the availability of a large variety of body styles to meet individual consumer requirements that include, among others, the sedan/saloon, hatchback, station wagon/estate, and minivan.\n\nRoad traffic accidents are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[6] Mary Ward became one of the first documented car fatalities in 1869 in Parsonstown, Ireland,[44] and Henry Bliss one of the United States\u0027 first pedestrian car casualties in 1899 in New York City.[45] There are now standard tests for safety in new cars, such as the EuroNCAP and the US NCAP tests,[46] and insurance-industry-backed tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).[47]\n\nWorldwide, road traffic is becoming ever safer, in part due to efforts by the government to implement safety features in cars (e.g., seat belts, air bags, etc.), reduce unsafe driving practices (e.g., speeding, drinking and driving and texting and driving) and make road design more safe by adding features such as speed bumps, which reduce vehicle speed, and roundabouts, which reduce the likelihood of a head-on-collision (as compared with an intersection).\n\nThe costs of car usage, which may include the cost of: acquiring the vehicle, repairs and auto maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance,[5] are weighed against the cost of the alternatives, and the value of the benefits - perceived and real - of vehicle usage. The benefits may include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence and convenience.[7] During\n\nThe Smart Fortwo car from 1998-2002, weighing 730 kg (1,610 lb)\n\nA Chevrolet Suburban extended-length SUV weighs 3,300 kg (7,200 lb) (gross weight)[37]\n\nSeating and body style\n\nSafety\n\nResult of a serious car accident\n\nCosts and benefits\n\nthe 1920s, cars had another benefit: \"[c]ouples finally had a way to head off on unchaperoned dates, plus they had a private space to snuggle up close at the end of the night.\"[49]\n\nSimilarly the costs to society of encompassing car use, which may include those of: maintaining roads, land use, air pollution, road congestion, public health, health care, and of disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life, can be balanced against the value of the benefits to society that car use generates. The societal benefits may include: economy benefits, such as job and wealth creation, of car production and maintenance, transportation provision, society wellbeing derived from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the tax opportunities. The ability for humans to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[8]\n\nWhile there are different types of fuel that may power cars, most rely on gasoline or diesel. The United States Environmental Protection Agency states that the average vehicle emits 8,887 grams of carbon dioxide per gallon of gasoline. The average vehicle running on diesel fuel will emit 10,180 grams of carbon dioxide.[50] Many governments are using fiscal policies (such as road tax or the US gas guzzler tax) to influence vehicle purchase decisions, with a low CO2 figure often resulting in reduced taxation.[51] Fuel taxes may act as an incentive for the production of more efficient, hence less polluting, car designs (e.g. hybrid vehicles) and the development of alternative fuels. High fuel taxes may provide a strong incentive for consumers to purchase lighter, smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, or to not drive. On average, today\u0027s cars are about 75 percent recyclable, and using recycled steel helps reduce energy use and pollution.[52] In the United States Congress, federally mandated fuel efficiency standards have been debated regularly, passenger car standards have not risen above the 27.5 miles per US gallon (8.6 L/100 km; 33.0 mpg‑imp) standard set in 1985. Light truck standards have changed more frequently, and were set at 22.2 miles per US gallon (10.6 L/100 km; 26.7 mpg‑imp) in 2007.[53]\n\nThe manufacture of vehicles is resource intensive, and many manufacturers now report on the environmental performance of their factories, including energy usage, waste and water consumption.[54]\n\nThe growth in popularity of the car allowed cities to sprawl, therefore encouraging more travel by car resulting in inactivity and obesity, which in turn can lead to increased risk of a variety of diseases.[55]\n\nTransportation (of all types including trucks, buses and cars) is a major contributor to air pollution in most industrialised nations. According to the American Surface Transportation Policy Project nearly half of all Americans are breathing unhealthy air. Their study showed air quality in dozens of metropolitan areas has worsened over the last decade.[56]\n\nAnimals and plants are often negatively impacted by cars via habitat destruction and pollution. Over the lifetime of the average car the \"loss of habitat potential\" may be over 50,000 m2 (540,000 sq ft) based on primary production correlations.[57] Animals are also killed every year on roads by cars, referred to as roadkill. More recent road developments are including significant environmental mitigations in their designs such as green bridges to allow wildlife crossings, and creating wildlife corridors.\n\nRoad congestion is an issue in many major cities. (pictured is Chang\u0027an Avenue in Beijing)[48]\n\nEnvironmental impact\n\nVehicles in use per country from 2001 to 2007. It shows the significant growth in BRIC.\n\nWorld map of passenger cars per 1000 people\n\nGrowth in the popularity of vehicles and commuting has led to traffic congestion. Brussels was considered Europe\u0027s most congested city in 2011 according to TomTom.[58]\n\nCar propulsion technologies that are under development include gasoline/electric and plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles, hydrogen cars, biofuels, and various alternative fuels. Research into future alternative forms of power include the development of fuel cells, Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), stirling engines,[59] and even using the stored energy of compressed air or liquid nitrogen.\n\nNew materials which may replace steel car bodies include duralumin, fiberglass, carbon fiber, biocomposites, and carbon nanotubes. Telematics technology is allowing more and more people to share cars, on a pay-as-you-go basis, through car share and carpool schemes. Communication is also evolving due to connected car systems.[60]\n\nFully autonomous vehicles, also known as driverless cars, already exist in prototype (such as the Google driverless car), and are expected to be commercially available around 2020. According to urban designer and futurist Michael E. Arth, driverless electric vehicles-in conjunction with the increased use of virtual reality for work, travel, and pleasure-could reduce the world\u0027s 800 million vehicles to a fraction of that number within a few decades.[61] This would be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers, which are not in use and parked 90% of the time, would be traded for public self-driving taxis that would be in near constant use. This would also allow for getting the appropriate vehicle for the particular need-a bus could come for a group of people, a limousine could come for a special night out, and a Segway could come for a short trip down the street for one person. Children could be chauffeured in supervised safety, DUIs would no longer exist, and 41,000 lives could be saved each year in the US alone.[62][63]\n\nThere have been several projects aiming to develop a car on the principles of open design, an approach to designing in which the plans for the machinery and systems are publicly shared, often without monetary compensation. The projects include OScar, Riversimple (through 40fires.org)[64] and c,mm,n.[65] None of the projects have reached significant success in terms of developing a car as a whole both from hardware and software perspective and no mass production ready open-source based design have been introduced as of late 2009. Some car hacking through on-board diagnostics (OBD) has been done so far.[66]\n\nThe automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells the world\u0027s motor vehicles. In 2008, more than 70 million motor vehicles, including cars and commercial vehicles were produced worldwide.[67]\n\nIn 2007, a total of 71.9 million new cars were sold worldwide: 22.9 million in Europe, 21.4 million in the Asia-Pacific Region, 19.4 million in the USA and Canada, 4.4 million in Latin America, 2.4 million in the Middle East and 1.4 million in Africa.[68] The markets in North America and Japan were stagnant, while those in South America and other parts of Asia grew strongly. Of the major markets, China, Russia, Brazil and India saw the most rapid growth.\n\nAbout 250 million vehicles are in use in the United States. Around the world, there were about 806 million cars and light trucks on the road in 2007; they burn over 260 billion US gallons (980,000,000 m3) of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly. The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China and India.[11] In the opinion of some, urban transport systems based around the car have\n\nEmerging car technologies\n\nAutonomous car\n\nA robotic Volkswagen Passat shown at Stanford University is a driverless car\n\nOpen source development\n\nIndustry\n\nproved unsustainable, consuming excessive energy, affecting the health of populations, and delivering a declining level of service despite increasing investments. Many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars.[69][70][71] The sustainable transport movement focuses on solutions to these problems.\n\nIn 2008, with rapidly rising oil prices, industries such as the automotive industry, are experiencing a combination of pricing pressures from raw material costs and changes in consumer buying habits. The industry is also facing increasing external competition from the public transport sector, as consumers re-evaluate their private vehicle usage.[72] Roughly half of the US\u0027s fifty-one light vehicle plants are projected to permanently close in the coming years, with the loss of another 200,000 jobs in the sector, on top of the 560,000 jobs lost this decade.[73] Combined with robust growth in China, in 2009, this resulted in China becoming the largest car producer and market in the world. China 2009 sales had increased to 13.6 million, a significant increase from one million of domestic car sales in 2000.[74] Since then however, even in China and other BRIC countries, the automotive production is again falling.[75]\n\nEstablished alternatives for some aspects of car use include public transit such as buses, trolleybuses, trains, subways, tramways light rail, cycling, and walking. Car-share arrangements and carpooling are also increasingly popular, in the US and Europe.[77] For example, in the US, some car-sharing services have experienced double-digit growth in revenue and membership growth between 2006 and 2007. Services like car sharing offering a residents to \"share\" a vehicle rather than own a car in already congested neighborhoods.[78] Bike-share systems have been tried in some European cities, including Copenhagen and Amsterdam. Similar programs have been experimented with in a number of US Cities.[79] Additional individual modes of transport, such as personal rapid transit could serve as an alternative to cars if they prove to be socially accepted.[80]\n\nThe term motorcar has formerly also been used in the context of electrified rail systems to denote a car which functions as a small locomotive but also provides space for passengers and baggage. These locomotive cars were often used on suburban routes by both interurban and intercity railroad systems.[81]\n\nCar costs Car classification Carfree city\n\nList of countries by automobile production List of countries by vehicles per capita Lists of automobiles\n\nMotor vehicle theft Noise pollution\n\nPeak car Steering Traffic collision\n\nA car being assembled in a factory\n\nAlternatives\n\nThe Vélib\u0027 in Paris is the largest bikesharing system outside of China[76]\n\nOther meanings\n\nSee also\n\n1.

By 1895 about 30 vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after disputes with their backers. Benz, Maybach and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other\u0027s early work. They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies, Daimler and Maybach were no longer part of DMG. Daimler died in 1900 and later that year, Maybach designed an engine named \u003ci\u003eDaimler-Mercedes\u003c/i\u003e that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by\n\u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Jellinek\"\u003eEmil Jelline\u003c/a\u003ek. This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country. Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine, which generated 35 hp. Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own. Rights to the \u003ci\u003eDaimler\u003c/i\u003e brand name were sold to other manufacturers.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKarl Benz proposed co-operation between DMG and Benz \u0026amp; Cie. when economic conditions began to deteriorate in Germany following the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War\"\u003eFirst World War\u003c/a\u003e, but the directors of DMG refused to consider it initially. Negotiations between the two companies resumed several years later when these conditions worsened and, in 1924 they signed an Agreement of Mutual Interest, valid until the year 2000. Both enterprises standardized design, production, purchasing, and sales and they advertised or marketed their car models jointly, although keeping their respective brands. On 28 June 1926, Benz \u0026amp; Cie. and DMG finally merged as the Daimler-Benz company, baptizing all of its cars Mercedes Benz, as a brand honoring the most important model of the DMG cars, the Maybach design later referred to as the 1902 Mercedes-35 hp, along with the Benz name.

The industry is also facing increasing external competition from the public transport sector, as consumers re-evaluate their private vehicle usage.[72] Roughly half of the US\u0027s fifty-one light vehicle plants are projected to permanently close in the coming years, with the loss of another 200,000 jobs in the sector, on top of the 560,000 jobs lost this decade.[73] Combined with robust growth in China, in 2009, this resulted in China becoming the largest car producer and market in the world. China 2009 sales had increased to 13.6 million, a significant increase from one million of domestic car sales in 2000.[74] Since then however, even in China and other BRIC countries, the automotive production is again falling.[75]\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEstablished alternatives for some aspects of car use include \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transit\"\u003epublic transi\u003c/a\u003et such as buses, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolleybus\"\u003etrolleybuse\u003c/a\u003es, trains, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit\"\u003esubway\u003c/a\u003es, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram_system\"\u003etramways\u003c/a\u003e light rail, cycling, and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking\"\u003ewalking\u003c/a\u003e.

Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods.[2][3] Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car, when German inventor Karl Benz built his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.\n\nCars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort and safety, and controlling a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. Examples include rear reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in car entertainment. Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. This causes air pollution and is also blamed for contributing to climate change and global warming.[4] Vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, began to become commercially available in 2008.\n\nThere are costs and benefits to car use. The costs include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance.[5] The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, health care, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Road traffic accidents are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[6]\n\nThe benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience.[7] The societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the taxes. The ability for people to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[8] It was estimated in 2014 that the number of cars was over 1.25 billion vehicles,[9] up from the 500 million of 1986.[10] The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China, India and other newly industrialized countries.[11]\n\n1 Etymology 2 History\n\nContents\n\n3 Mass production\n\n4 Fuel and propulsion technologies\n\n5 User interface\n\n6 Lighting\n\n7 Weight\n\n8 Seating and body style\n\n9 Safety\n\n10 Costs and benefits\n\n11 Environmental impact\n\n12 Emerging car technologies\n\n12.1 Autonomous car 12.2 Open source development\n\n13 Industry 14 Alternatives 15 Other meanings\n\n16 See also\n\n17 References\n\n18 Further reading\n\n19 External links\n\nThe word\n\ncar\n\nis believed to originate from the Latin word\n\ncarrus\n\nor\n\ncarrum\n\n(\"wheeled vehicle\"), or the Middle English word\n\ncarre\n\n(meaning \"two-wheel cart\", from Old North French). In turn, these originated from the Gaulish word\n\nkarros (a Gallic chariot).[12][13] It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.[14][15] \"Motor car\" is attested from 1895, and is the usual formal name for cars in British English.[3] \"Autocar\" is a variant that is also attested from 1895, but that is now considered archaic. It literally means \"self-propelled car\".[16] The term \"horseless carriage\" was used by some to refer to the first cars at the time that they were being built, and is attested from 1895.[17]\n\nThe word \"automobile\" is a classical compound derived from the Ancient Greek word autós (αὐτός), meaning \"self\", and the Latin word mobilis, meaning \"movable\". It entered the English language from French, and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of Great Britain in 1897.[18] Over time, the word \"automobile\" fell out of favour in Britain, and was replaced by \"motor car\".\n\n\"Automobile\" remains chiefly North American, particularly as a formal or commercial term.[19] An abbreviated form, \"auto\", was formerly a common way to refer to cars in English, but is now considered old-fashioned. The word is still very common as an adjective in American English, usually in compound formations like \"auto industry\" and \"auto mechanic\".[20][21] The abbreviated form is also used in Dutch and German.\n\nThe first working steam-powered vehicle was designed-and most likely built-by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672. It was a 65-cm-long scale-model toy for the Chinese Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger.[7][22][23] It is not known if Verbiest\u0027s model was ever built.[23]\n\nNicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle or car in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle.[24] He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts.[25] His inventions were, however, handicapped by problems with water supply and\n\n[25]\n\nEtymology\n\nHistory\n\nmaintaining steam pressure.[25] In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods, and was of little practical use.\n\nThe development of external combustion engines is detailed as part of the history of the car, but often treated separately from the development of true cars. A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers. Sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865.\n\nIn 1807, Nicéphore Niépce and his brother Claude created what was probably the world\u0027s first internal combustion engine (which they called a Pyréolophore), but they chose to install it in a boat on the river Saone in France.[26] Coincidentally, in 1807 the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed his own \u0027de Rivaz internal combustion engine\u0027 and used it to develop the world\u0027s first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The Niépces\u0027 Pyréolophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.[26] Neither design was very successful, as was the case with others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and Etienne Lenoir with his hippomobile, who each produced vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines.[1]\n\nIn November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouvé demonstrated the first working (three- wheeled) car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris.[27] Although several other German engineers (including Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, and Siegfried Marcus) were working on the problem at about the same time, Karl Benz generally is acknowledged as the inventor of the modern car.[1]\n\nIn 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first Motorwagen was built in 1885 in Mannheim, Germany. He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, Benz \u0026 Cie., which was founded in 1883). Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a model intended for affordability. They also were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products. Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany. In August 1888 Bertha Benz, the wife of Karl Benz, undertook the first road trip by car, to prove the road-worthiness of her husband\u0027s invention.\n\nCugnot\u0027s 1771 fardier à vapeur, as preserved at the Musée des Arts et Métiers, Paris\n\nGustave Trouvé\u0027s tricycle, the first ever electric automobile to be shown in public\n\nKarl Benz, the inventor of the modern car\n\nThe original Benz Patent- Motorwagen, first built in 1885 and awarded the patent for the concept\n\nIn 1896, Benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion flat engine, called\n\nboxermotor. During the last years of the nineteenth century, Benz was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and, because of its size, Benz \u0026 Cie., became a joint-stock company. The first motor car in central Europe and one of the first factory-made cars in the world, was produced by Czech company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed to Tatra) in 1897, the Präsident automobil.\n\nDaimler and Maybach founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) in Cannstatt in 1890, and sold their first car in 1892 under the brand name Daimler. It was a horse-drawn stagecoach built by another manufacturer, which they retrofitted with an engine of their design. By 1895 about 30 vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after disputes with their backers. Benz, Maybach and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other\u0027s early work. They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies, Daimler and Maybach were no longer part of DMG. Daimler died in 1900 and later that year, Maybach designed an engine named Daimler-Mercedes that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by Emil Jellinek. This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country. Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine, which generated 35 hp. Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own. Rights to the Daimler brand name were sold to other manufacturers.\n\nKarl Benz proposed co-operation between DMG and Benz \u0026 Cie. when economic conditions began to deteriorate in Germany following the First World War, but the directors of DMG refused to consider it initially. Negotiations between the two companies resumed several years later when these conditions worsened and, in 1924 they signed an Agreement of Mutual Interest, valid until the year 2000. Both enterprises standardized design, production, purchasing, and sales and they advertised or marketed their car models jointly, although keeping their respective brands. On 28 June 1926, Benz \u0026 Cie. and DMG finally merged as the Daimler-Benz company, baptizing all of its cars Mercedes Benz, as a brand honoring the most important model of the DMG cars, the Maybach design later referred to as the 1902 Mercedes-35 hp, along with the Benz name. Karl Benz remained a member of the board of directors of Daimler-Benz until his death in 1929, and at times his two sons also participated in the management of the company.\n\nIn 1890, Émile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began producing vehicles with Daimler engines, and so laid the foundation of the automotive industry in France. In 1891, Auguste Doriot and his Peugeot colleague Louis Rigoulot completed the longest trip by a gasoline-powered vehicle when their self-designed and built Daimler powered Peugeot Type 3 completed 2,100 km (1,300 miles) from Valentigney to Paris and Brest and back again. They were attached to the first Paris-Brest-Paris bicycle race, but finished 6 days after the winning cyclist, Charles Terront.\n\nThe first design for an American car with a gasoline internal combustion engine was made in 1877 by George Selden of Rochester, New York. Selden applied for a patent for a car in 1879, but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built. After a delay of sixteen years and a series of attachments to his application, on 5 November 1895, Selden was granted a United States patent (U.S. Patent 549,160) for a two-stroke car engine, which hindered, more than encouraged, development of cars in the United States. His patent was challenged by Henry Ford and others, and overturned in 191 .\n\nIn 1893, the first running, gasoline-powered American car was built and road-tested by the Duryea brothers of Springfield, Massachusetts. The first public run of the Duryea Motor Wagon took place on 21 September 1893, on Taylor Street in Metro Center Springfield.[28][29] The Studebaker Automobile Company, subsidiary of a long-established wagon and coach manufacturer, started to build cars in 1897[30]:p.66 and commenced sales of electric vehicles in 1902 and gasoline vehicles in 1904.[31]\n\nBertha Benz, the first long distance driver\n\nÉmile Levassor\n\nIn Britain, there had been several attempts to build steam cars with varying degrees of success, with Thomas Rickett even attempting a production run in 1860.[32] Santler from Malvern is recognized by the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain as having made the first gasoline-powered car in the country in 1894,[33] followed by Frederick William Lanchester in 1895, but these were both one-offs.[33] The first production vehicles in Great Britain came from the Daimler Company, a company founded by Harry J. Lawson in 1896, after purchasing the right to use the name of the engines. Lawson\u0027s company made its first car in 1897, and they bore the name Daimler.[33]\n\nIn 1892, German engineer Rudolf Diesel was granted a patent for a \"New Rational Combustion Engine\". In 1897, he built the first diesel engine.[1] Steam-, electric-, and gasoline-powered vehicles competed for decades, with gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s. Although various pistonless rotary engine designs have attempted to compete with the conventional piston and crankshaft design, only Mazda\u0027s version of the Wankel engine has had more than very limited success.\n\nLarge-scale, production-line manufacturing of affordable cars was started by Ransom Olds in 1901 at his Oldsmobile factory in Lansing, Michigan and based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Brunel at the Portsmouth Block Mills, England, in 1802. The assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the U.S. by Thomas Blanchard in 1821, at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts.[34] This concept was greatly expanded by Henry Ford, beginning in 1913 with the world\u0027s first moving assembly line for cars at the Highland Park Ford Plant.\n\nAs a result, Ford\u0027s cars came off the line in fifteen-minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, increasing productivity eightfold, while using less manpower (from 12.5-man-hours to 1 hour 33 minutes).[35] It was so successful, paint became a bottleneck. Only Japan Black would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1913, until fast-drying Duco lacquer was developed in 1926. This is the source of Ford\u0027s apocryphal remark, \"any color as long as it\u0027s black\".[35] In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months\u0027 pay.[35]\n\nFord\u0027s complex safety procedures- especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about-dramatically reduced the rate of injury. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called \"Fordism,\" and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.\n\nArmand Peugeot\n\nMass production\n\nRansom E. Olds founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company (Oldsmobile) in 1897\n\nHenry Ford founded Ford Motor Company in 1903\n\n1927 Ford Model T\n\nIn the automotive industry, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, Citroen was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, had disappeared.[35]\n\nDevelopment of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world\u0027s attention. Key developments included electric ignition and the electric self-starter (both by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 1910-1911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes.\n\nSince the 1920s, nearly all cars have been mass-produced to meet market needs, so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design. It was Alfred P. Sloan who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company, called the General Motors Companion Make Program, so that buyers could \"move up\" as their fortunes improved.\n\nReflecting the rapid pace of change, makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1930s, LaSalles, sold by Cadillac, used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile; in the 1950s, Chevrolet shared hood, doors, roof, and windows with Pontiac; by the 1990s, corporate powertrains and shared platforms (with interchangeable brakes, suspension, and other parts) were common. Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as Apperson, Cole, Dorris, Haynes, or Premier, could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the Great Depression, by 1940, only 17 of those were left.[35]\n\nIn Europe, much the same would happen. Morris set up its production line at Cowley in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford\u0027s practice of vertical integration, buying Hotchkiss (engines), Wrigley (gearboxes), and Osberton (radiators), for instance, as well as competitors, such as Wolseley: in 1925, Morris had 41% of total British car production. Most British small-car assemblers, from Abbey to Xtra, had gone under. Citroen did the same in France, coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as Renault\u0027s 10CV and Peugeot\u0027s 5CV, they produced 550,000 cars in 1925, and Mors, Hurtu, and others could not compete.[35] Germany\u0027s first mass-manufactured car, the Opel 4PS Laubfrosch (Tree Frog), came off the line at Russelsheim in 1924, soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany, with 37.5% of the market.[35]\n\nIn Japan, car production was very limited before World War II. Only a handful of companines were producing vehicles in limited numbers, and these were small, three-wheeled for commercial uses, like Daihatsu, or were the result of partnering with European companies, like Isuzu building the Wolseley A-9 in 1922. Mitsubishi was also partnered with Fiat and built the Mitsubishi Model A based on a Fiat vehicle. Toyota, Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, and Honda began as companies producing non-automotive products before the war, switching to car production during the 1950s. Kiichiro Toyoda\u0027s decision to take Toyoda Loom Works into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become Toyota Motor Corporation, the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Subaru, meanwhile, was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as Fuji Heavy Industries, as a result of having been broken up under keiretsu legislation.\n\nMost cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the deflagration (rather than detonation) combustion of hydrocarbon fossil fuels, mostly gasoline (petrol) and diesel, as well as some Autogas and CNG. Hydrocarbon fuels cause air pollution and contribute to climate change and global warming.[4] Rapidly increasing oil prices, concerns about oil\n\nKiichiro Toyoda, president of the Toyota Motor Corporation 1941-1950\n\nMass production at a Toyota plant in the 1950s\n\nFuel and propulsion technologies\n\ndependence, tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars. Efforts to improve or replace existing technologies include the development of hybrid vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles. Vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries. Cars for racing or speed records have sometimes employed jet or rocket engines, but these are impractical for common use.\n\nOil consumption in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries has been abundantly pushed by car growth; the 1985-2003 oil glut even fuelled the sales of low-economy vehicles in OECD countries. The BRIC countries are adding to this consumption; in December 2009 China was briefly the largest car market.[36]\n\nCars are equipped with controls used for driving, passenger comfort and safety, normally operated by a combination of the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 2000s-era cars. These controls include a steering wheel, pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car\u0027s speed (and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch pedal), a shift lever or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights, ventilation and other functions. Modern cars\u0027 controls are now standardised, such as the location for the accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for example the electric car and the integration of mobile communications.\n\nSince the car was first invented, its controls have become fewer and simpler through automation. For example, all cars once had a manual controls for the choke valve, clutch, ignition timing, and a crank instead of an electric starter. However new controls have also been added to vehicles, making them more complex. Examples include air conditioning, navigation systems, and in car entertainment. Another trend is the replacement of physical knob and switches for secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as BMW\u0027s iDrive and Ford\u0027s MyFord Touch. Another change is that while early cars\u0027 pedals were physically linked to the brake mechanism and throttle, in the 2010s, cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with electronic controls.\n\nCars are typically fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, which are used to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on the ceiling of the car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.\n\nThe Nissan Leaf is an all-electric car launched in December 2010\n\nUser interface\n\nIn the Ford Model T the left-side hand lever sets the rear wheel parking brakes and puts the transmission in neutral. The lever to the right controls the throttle. The lever on the left of the steering column is for ignition timing. The left foot pedal changes the two forward gears while the centre pedal controls reverse. The right pedal is the brake.\n\nLighting\n\nLED daytime running lights on an Audi A4\n\nWeight\n\nIn the United States, \"from 1975 to 1980, average [car] weight dropped from 1,842 to 1,464 kg (4,060 to 3,228 lb), likely in response to rising gasoline prices\" and new fuel efficiency standards.[38] The average new car weighed 1,461 kg (3,221 lb) in 1987 but 1,818 kg (4,009 lb) in 2010, due to modern steel safety cages, anti-lock brakes, airbags, and \"more-powerful-if more-efficient-engines.\"[39] Heavier cars are safer for the driver, from an accident perspective, but more dangerous for other vehicles and road users.[39] The weight of a car influences fuel consumption and performance, with more weight resulting in increased fuel consumption and decreased performance. The SmartFortwo, a small city car, weighs 750-795 kg (1,655-1,755 lb). Heavier cars include full-size cars, SUVs and extended-length SUVs like the Suburban.\n\nAccording to research conducted by Julian Allwood of the University of Cambridge, global energy use could be heavily reduced by using lighter cars, and an average weight of 500 kg (1,100 lb) has been said to be well achievable.[40] In some competitions such as the Shell Eco Marathon, average car weights of 45 kg (99 lb) have also been achieved.[41][42] These cars are only single-seaters (still falling within the definition of a car, although 4-seater cars are more common), but they nevertheless demonstrate the amount by which car weights could still be reduced, and the subsequent lower fuel use (i.e. up to a fuel use of 2560 km/l).[43]\n\nMost cars are designed to carry multiple occupants, often with four or five seats.\n\nCars with five seats typically seat two passengers in the front and three in the rear. Full-size cars and large sport utility vehicles can often carry six, seven, or more occupants depending on the arrangement of the seats. On the other hand, sports cars are most often designed with only two seats. The differing needs for passenger capacity and their luggage or cargo space has resulted in the availability of a large variety of body styles to meet individual consumer requirements that include, among others, the sedan/saloon, hatchback, station wagon/estate, and minivan.\n\nRoad traffic accidents are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[6] Mary Ward became one of the first documented car fatalities in 1869 in Parsonstown, Ireland,[44] and Henry Bliss one of the United States\u0027 first pedestrian car casualties in 1899 in New York City.[45] There are now standard tests for safety in new cars, such as the EuroNCAP and the US NCAP tests,[46] and insurance-industry-backed tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).[47]\n\nWorldwide, road traffic is becoming ever safer, in part due to efforts by the government to implement safety features in cars (e.g., seat belts, air bags, etc.), reduce unsafe driving practices (e.g., speeding, drinking and driving and texting and driving) and make road design more safe by adding features such as speed bumps, which reduce vehicle speed, and roundabouts, which reduce the likelihood of a head-on-collision (as compared with an intersection).\n\nThe costs of car usage, which may include the cost of: acquiring the vehicle, repairs and auto maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance,[5] are weighed against the cost of the alternatives, and the value of the benefits - perceived and real - of vehicle usage. The benefits may include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence and convenience.[7] During\n\nThe Smart Fortwo car from 1998-2002, weighing 730 kg (1,610 lb)\n\nA Chevrolet Suburban extended-length SUV weighs 3,300 kg (7,200 lb) (gross weight)[37]\n\nSeating and body style\n\nSafety\n\nResult of a serious car accident\n\nCosts and benefits\n\nthe 1920s, cars had another benefit: \"[c]ouples finally had a way to head off on unchaperoned dates, plus they had a private space to snuggle up close at the end of the night.\"[49]\n\nSimilarly the costs to society of encompassing car use, which may include those of: maintaining roads, land use, air pollution, road congestion, public health, health care, and of disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life, can be balanced against the value of the benefits to society that car use generates. The societal benefits may include: economy benefits, such as job and wealth creation, of car production and maintenance, transportation provision, society wellbeing derived from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the tax opportunities. The ability for humans to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[8]\n\nWhile there are different types of fuel that may power cars, most rely on gasoline or diesel. The United States Environmental Protection Agency states that the average vehicle emits 8,887 grams of carbon dioxide per gallon of gasoline. The average vehicle running on diesel fuel will emit 10,180 grams of carbon dioxide.[50] Many governments are using fiscal policies (such as road tax or the US gas guzzler tax) to influence vehicle purchase decisions, with a low CO2 figure often resulting in reduced taxation.[51] Fuel taxes may act as an incentive for the production of more efficient, hence less polluting, car designs (e.g. hybrid vehicles) and the development of alternative fuels. High fuel taxes may provide a strong incentive for consumers to purchase lighter, smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, or to not drive. On average, today\u0027s cars are about 75 percent recyclable, and using recycled steel helps reduce energy use and pollution.[52] In the United States Congress, federally mandated fuel efficiency standards have been debated regularly, passenger car standards have not risen above the 27.5 miles per US gallon (8.6 L/100 km; 33.0 mpg‑imp) standard set in 1985. Light truck standards have changed more frequently, and were set at 22.2 miles per US gallon (10.6 L/100 km; 26.7 mpg‑imp) in 2007.[53]\n\nThe manufacture of vehicles is resource intensive, and many manufacturers now report on the environmental performance of their factories, including energy usage, waste and water consumption.[54]\n\nThe growth in popularity of the car allowed cities to sprawl, therefore encouraging more travel by car resulting in inactivity and obesity, which in turn can lead to increased risk of a variety of diseases.[55]\n\nTransportation (of all types including trucks, buses and cars) is a major contributor to air pollution in most industrialised nations. According to the American Surface Transportation Policy Project nearly half of all Americans are breathing unhealthy air. Their study showed air quality in dozens of metropolitan areas has worsened over the last decade.[56]\n\nAnimals and plants are often negatively impacted by cars via habitat destruction and pollution. Over the lifetime of the average car the \"loss of habitat potential\" may be over 50,000 m2 (540,000 sq ft) based on primary production correlations.[57] Animals are also killed every year on roads by cars, referred to as roadkill. More recent road developments are including significant environmental mitigations in their designs such as green bridges to allow wildlife crossings, and creating wildlife corridors.\n\nRoad congestion is an issue in many major cities. (pictured is Chang\u0027an Avenue in Beijing)[48]\n\nEnvironmental impact\n\nVehicles in use per country from 2001 to 2007. It shows the significant growth in BRIC.\n\nWorld map of passenger cars per 1000 people\n\nGrowth in the popularity of vehicles and commuting has led to traffic congestion. Brussels was considered Europe\u0027s most congested city in 2011 according to TomTom.[58]\n\nCar propulsion technologies that are under development include gasoline/electric and plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles, hydrogen cars, biofuels, and various alternative fuels. Research into future alternative forms of power include the development of fuel cells, Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), stirling engines,[59] and even using the stored energy of compressed air or liquid nitrogen.\n\nNew materials which may replace steel car bodies include duralumin, fiberglass, carbon fiber, biocomposites, and carbon nanotubes. Telematics technology is allowing more and more people to share cars, on a pay-as-you-go basis, through car share and carpool schemes. Communication is also evolving due to connected car systems.[60]\n\nFully autonomous vehicles, also known as driverless cars, already exist in prototype (such as the Google driverless car), and are expected to be commercially available around 2020. According to urban designer and futurist Michael E. Arth, driverless electric vehicles-in conjunction with the increased use of virtual reality for work, travel, and pleasure-could reduce the world\u0027s 800 million vehicles to a fraction of that number within a few decades.[61] This would be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers, which are not in use and parked 90% of the time, would be traded for public self-driving taxis that would be in near constant use. This would also allow for getting the appropriate vehicle for the particular need-a bus could come for a group of people, a limousine could come for a special night out, and a Segway could come for a short trip down the street for one person. Children could be chauffeured in supervised safety, DUIs would no longer exist, and 41,000 lives could be saved each year in the US alone.[62][63]\n\nThere have been several projects aiming to develop a car on the principles of open design, an approach to designing in which the plans for the machinery and systems are publicly shared, often without monetary compensation. The projects include OScar, Riversimple (through 40fires.org)[64] and c,mm,n.[65] None of the projects have reached significant success in terms of developing a car as a whole both from hardware and software perspective and no mass production ready open-source based design have been introduced as of late 2009. Some car hacking through on-board diagnostics (OBD) has been done so far.[66]\n\nThe automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells the world\u0027s motor vehicles. In 2008, more than 70 million motor vehicles, including cars and commercial vehicles were produced worldwide.[67]\n\nIn 2007, a total of 71.9 million new cars were sold worldwide: 22.9 million in Europe, 21.4 million in the Asia-Pacific Region, 19.4 million in the USA and Canada, 4.4 million in Latin America, 2.4 million in the Middle East and 1.4 million in Africa.[68] The markets in North America and Japan were stagnant, while those in South America and other parts of Asia grew strongly. Of the major markets, China, Russia, Brazil and India saw the most rapid growth.\n\nAbout 250 million vehicles are in use in the United States. Around the world, there were about 806 million cars and light trucks on the road in 2007; they burn over 260 billion US gallons (980,000,000 m3) of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly. The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China and India.[11] In the opinion of some, urban transport systems based around the car have\n\nEmerging car technologies\n\nAutonomous car\n\nA robotic Volkswagen Passat shown at Stanford University is a driverless car\n\nOpen source development\n\nIndustry\n\nproved unsustainable, consuming excessive energy, affecting the health of populations, and delivering a declining level of service despite increasing investments. Many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars.[69][70][71] The sustainable transport movement focuses on solutions to these problems.\n\nIn 2008, with rapidly rising oil prices, industries such as the automotive industry, are experiencing a combination of pricing pressures from raw material costs and changes in consumer buying habits. The industry is also facing increasing external competition from the public transport sector, as consumers re-evaluate their private vehicle usage.[72] Roughly half of the US\u0027s fifty-one light vehicle plants are projected to permanently close in the coming years, with the loss of another 200,000 jobs in the sector, on top of the 560,000 jobs lost this decade.[73] Combined with robust growth in China, in 2009, this resulted in China becoming the largest car producer and market in the world. China 2009 sales had increased to 13.6 million, a significant increase from one million of domestic car sales in 2000.[74] Since then however, even in China and other BRIC countries, the automotive production is again falling.[75]\n\nEstablished alternatives for some aspects of car use include public transit such as buses, trolleybuses, trains, subways, tramways light rail, cycling, and walking. Car-share arrangements and carpooling are also increasingly popular, in the US and Europe.[77] For example, in the US, some car-sharing services have experienced double-digit growth in revenue and membership growth between 2006 and 2007. Services like car sharing offering a residents to \"share\" a vehicle rather than own a car in already congested neighborhoods.[78] Bike-share systems have been tried in some European cities, including Copenhagen and Amsterdam. Similar programs have been experimented with in a number of US Cities.[79] Additional individual modes of transport, such as personal rapid transit could serve as an alternative to cars if they prove to be socially accepted.[80]\n\nThe term motorcar has formerly also been used in the context of electrified rail systems to denote a car which functions as a small locomotive but also provides space for passengers and baggage. These locomotive cars were often used on suburban routes by both interurban and intercity railroad systems.[81]\n\nCar costs Car classification Carfree city\n\nList of countries by automobile production List of countries by vehicles per capita Lists of automobiles\n\nMotor vehicle theft Noise pollution\n\nPeak car Steering Traffic collision\n\nA car being assembled in a factory\n\nAlternatives\n\nThe Vélib\u0027 in Paris is the largest bikesharing system outside of China[76]\n\nOther meanings\n\nSee also\n\n1.

vehicle the engine and drive wheels are found. Many different combinations of engine location and driven wheels are found in practice, and the location of each is dependent on the application for which the vehicle will be used. Factors influencing the design choice include cost, complexity, reliability, packaging (location and size of the passenger compartment and boot), weight distribution, and the vehicle\u0027s intended handling characteristics.\n\nLayouts can roughly be divided into two categories: front- or rear-wheel drive. Four-wheel-drive vehicles may take on the characteristics of either, depending on how power is distributed to the wheels.\n\n1 Front-wheel-drive layouts\n\n1.1 Characteristics 1.2 Advantages 1.3 Disadvantages\n\n2 Rear-wheel-drive layouts\n\n2.1 Characteristics 2.2 Advantages 2.3 Disadvantages\n\n3 Four-wheel-drive layouts\n\n3.1 Advantages 3.2 Disadvantages 3.3 Unusual 4WD layouts\n\n4 History and current use 5 See also 6 References\n\nFront-wheel-drive layouts are those in which the front wheels of the vehicle are driven. The most popular layout used in cars today is the front-engine, front-wheel drive, with the engine in front of the front axle, driving the front wheels. This layout is typically chosen for its compact packaging; since the engine and driven wheels are on the same side of the vehicle, there is no need for a central tunnel through the passenger compartment to accommodate a prop-shaft between the engine and the driven wheels.\n\nAs the steered wheels are also the driven wheels, FF (front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout) cars are generally considered superior to FR (front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout) cars in conditions such as snow, mud, or wet tarmac. The weight of the engine over the driven wheels also improves grip in such conditions. However, powerful cars rarely\n\nContents\n\nFront-wheel-drive layouts\n\nFF layout\n\nuse the FF layout because weight transference under acceleration reduces the weight on the front wheels and reduces their traction, limiting the torque which can be utilized. Electronic traction control can avoid wheelspin but largely negates the benefit of extra torque/power.\n\nA transverse engine (also known as \"east-west\") is commonly used in FF designs, in contrast to FR which uses a longitudinal engine. The FF layout also restricts the size of the engine that can be placed in modern engine compartments, as FF configurations usually have inline-4 and V6 engines, while longer engines such as inline-6 and 90° V8 will rarely fit. This is another reason luxury/sports cars avoid the FF layout. Exceptions do exist, such as the Volvo S80 (FWD/4WD) which uses transversely mounted inline-6 and V8 engines, and the Ford Taurus SHO, available with a 60° V8 and front-wheel drive.\n\nFront-wheel drive gives more interior space since the powertrain is a single unit contained in the engine compartment of the vehicle and there is no need to devote interior space for a driveshaft tunnel or rear differential, increasing the volume available for passengers and cargo.[1] There are some exceptions to this as rear engine designs do not take away interior space (see Porsche 911, and Volkswagen Beetle). It also has fewer components overall and thus lower weight.[1] The direct connection between engine and transaxle reduces the mass and mechanical inertia of the drivetrain compared to a rear-wheel-drive vehicle with a similar engine and transmission, allowing greater fuel economy.[1] In front-wheel-drive cars the mass of the drivetrain is placed over the driven wheels and thus moves the centre of gravity farther forward than a comparable rear-wheel-drive layout, improving traction and directional stability on wet, snowy, or icy surfaces.[1][2][3] Front-wheel-drive cars, with a front weight bias, tend to understeer at the limit which, according to Saab engineer Gunnar Larsson, is easier since it makes instinct correct in avoiding terminal oversteer, and less prone to result in fishtailing or a spin.[3][4]\n\nAccording to a sales brochure for the 1989 Lotus Elan, the ride and handling engineers at Lotus found that \"for a given vehicle weight, power and tyre size, a front-wheel-drive car was always faster over a given section of road.\"[5] However, this may only apply for cars with moderate power-to-weight ratio.[2][6][7] According to road test with two Dodge Daytonas, one FWD and one RWD, the road layout is also important for what configuration is the fastest.[3]\n\nWeight shifting limits the acceleration of a front-wheel-drive vehicle. During heavy acceleration, weight is shifted to the back, improving traction at the rear wheels at the expense of the front driving wheels; consequently, most racing cars are rear-wheel drive for acceleration. However, since front-wheel-drive cars have the weight of the engine over the driving wheels, the problem only applies in extreme conditions in which case the car understeers. On snow, ice, and sand, rear-wheel drive loses its traction advantage to front or all-wheel-drive vehicles which have greater weight over the driven wheels. Rear-wheel-drive cars with rear engine or mid engine configuration retain traction over the driven wheels, although fishtailing remains an issue on hard acceleration while in a turn. Some rear engine cars (e.g., Porsche 911) can suffer from reduced steering ability under heavy acceleration, since the engine is outside the wheelbase and at the opposite end of the car from the wheels doing the steering. A rear-wheel-drive car\u0027s centre of gravity is shifted rearward when heavily loaded with passengers or cargo, which may cause unpredictable handling behavior.[4]\n\nOn front-wheel-drive cars, the short driveshaft may reduce drivetrain elasticity, improving responsiveness.[4]\n\nInterior space: Since the powertrain is a single unit contained in the engine compartment of the vehicle, there is no need to devote interior space for a driveshaft tunnel or rear differential, increasing the volume available for passengers and cargo.[1]\n\nInstead, the tunnel may be used to route the exhaust system pipes. Weight: Fewer components usually means lower weight. Improved fuel efficiency due to less weight.[8]\n\nCost: Fewer material components and less installation complexity overall. However, the considerable MSRP differential between a FF and FR car cannot be attributed to layout alone. The difference is more probably explained by production volumes as most rear-wheel cars are usually in the sports/performance/luxury categories (which tend to be more upscale and/or have more powerful engines), while the FF configuration is typically in mass-produced\n\nCharacteristics\n\nAdvantages\n\nmainstream cars. Few modern \"family\" cars have rear-wheel drive as of 2009, so a direct cost comparison is not necessarily possible. A contrast could be somewhat drawn between the Audi A4 FrontTrak (which has an FF layout and front-wheel drive) and a rear-wheel-drive BMW 3 Series (which is FR), both which are in the compact executive car classification and use longitudinally mounted engines.[1]\n\nImproved drivetrain eficiency: the direct connection between engine and transaxle reduce the mass and mechanical inertia of the drivetrain compared to a rear-wheel-drive vehicle with a similar engine and transmission, allowing greater fuel economy.[1]\n\nAssembly efficiency: the powertrain can often be assembled and installed as a unit, which allows more efficient production.\n\nPlacing the mass of the drivetrain over the driven wheels moves the centre of gravity farther forward than a comparable rear-wheel-drive layout, improving traction and directional stability on wet, snowy, or icy surfaces.[1][2][3] Predictable handling characteristics: front-wheel-drive cars, with a front weight bias, tend to understeer at the limit, which (according to SAAB engineer Gunnar Larsson) is easier since it makes instinct correct in avoiding terminal oversteer, and less prone to result in fishtailing or a spin.[3][4]\n\nA skilled driver can control the movement of the car even while skidding by steering, throttling and pulling the hand brake (given that the hand brake operates the rear wheels as in most cases, with some Citroen and Saab models being notable exceptions).\n\nIt is easier to correct trailing-throttle or trailing-brake oversteer.[3]\n\nThe wheelbase can be extended without building a longer driveshaft (as with rear-wheel-driven cars).\n\nFront-engine front-wheel-drive layouts are \"nose heavy\" with more weight distribution forward, which makes them prone to understeer, especially in high horsepower applications.\n\nIf a front-engine front-wheel-drive layout is fitted with a four-wheel-drive, plus enthusiast driver aids, such as active front differential, active steering, and ultra-quick electrically adjustable shocks, this somewhat negate the understeer problem and allow the car to perform as well as a front-engine rear-wheel-drive car. These trick differentials, which are found on the Acura TL SH-AWD and Audi S4 3.0 TFSI quattro, and Audi RS5 4.2 FSI quattro, are heavy, complex, and expensive.[9][10] While these aids do tame front end plow, cars fitted with these systems are still at a disadvantage when track tested against rear-wheel drive vehicles (including those with added four-wheel drive[11]).[12]\n\nTorque steer is the tendency for some front-wheel-drive cars to pull to the left or right under hard acceleration. It is a result of the offset between the point about which the wheel steers (it is aligned with the points where the wheel is connected to the steering mechanisms) and the centroid of its contact patch. The tractive force acts through the centroid of the contact patch, and the offset of the steering point means that a turning moment about the axis of steering is generated. In an ideal situation, the left and right wheels would generate equal and opposite moments, canceling each other out; however, in reality, this is less likely to happen. Torque steer can be addressed by using a longitudinal layout, equal length drive shafts, half shafts, a multilink suspension or centre-point steering geometry.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19]\n\nIn a vehicle, the weight shifts back during acceleration, giving more traction to the rear wheels. This is one of the main reasons nearly all racing cars are rear-wheel drive. However, since front-wheel-drive cars have the weight of the engine over the driving wheels, the problem only applies in extreme conditions such as attempting to accelerate up a wet hill or attempting to beat another RWD car off the line.\n\nIn some towing situations, front-wheel-drive cars can be at a traction disadvantage since there will be less weight on the driving wheels. Because of this, the weight that the vehicle is rated to safely tow is likely to be less than that of a rear-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive vehicle of the same size and power.\n\nDue to geometry and packaging constraints, the CV joints (constant-velocity joints) attached to the wheel hub have a tendency to wear out much earlier than the universal joints typically used in their rear-wheel-drive counterparts (although rear-wheel-drive vehicles with independent rear suspension also employ CV joints and half-shafts). The significantly shorter drive axles on a front-wheel-drive car causes the joint to flex through a much wider degree of motion, compounded by additional stress and angles of steering, while the CV joints of a rear-wheel-drive car regularly see angles and wear of less than half that of front-wheel-drive vehicles.\n\nTurning circle - FF layouts almost always use a transverse engine (\"east-west\") installation, which limits the amount by which the front wheels can turn, thus increasing the turning circle of a front-wheel-drive car compared to a rear-wheel-drive one with the same wheelbase. A notable example is the original Mini. It is widely misconceived that this limitation is due to a limit on the angle at which a CV joint can be operated, but this is easily disproved by considering the turning circle of car models that use a longitudinal FF or F4 layout from Audi and (prior to 1992) Saab.\n\nThe FF transverse engine layout (also known as \"east-west\") restricts the size of the engine that can be placed in modern engine compartments, so it is rarely adopted by powerful luxury and sports cars. FF configurations can usually only accommodate inline-4 and V6 engines, while longer engines such as inline-6 and 90° big-bore V8 will rarely fit, though there are exceptions. One way around this problem is using a staggered engine.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nIt makes heavier use of the front tyres (i.e., accelerating, braking, and turning), causing more wear in the front than in a rear-wheel-drive layout.\n\nUnder extreme braking (like for instance in a panic stop), the already front heavy layout further reduces traction to the rear wheels. This results in disproportionate gripping forces focused at the front while the rear does not have enough weight to efectively use its brakes. Because the rear tyres\u0027 capabilities in braking are not very high, a significant number of cheaper front drive vehicles use drum brakes in the rear even today.\n\nThe steering \u0027feel\u0027 is more numbed than a RWD car. This is due to the extra weight of drive shafts and CV joint components that increase unsprung weight.\n\nRear-wheel drive (RWD) typically places the engine in the front of the vehicle and the driven wheels are located at the rear, a configuration known as front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (FR layout). The front mid-engine, rear mid-engine and rear engine layouts are also used. This was the traditional automobile layout for most vehicles up until the 1970s and 1980s.[20] Nearly all motorcycles and bicycles use rear-wheel drive as well, either by driveshaft, chain, or belt, since the front wheel is turned for steering, and it would be very difficult and cumbersome to \"bend\" the drive mechanism around the turn of the front wheel. A relatively rare exception is with the \u0027moving bottom bracket\u0027 type of recumbent bicycle, where the entire drivetrain, including pedals and chain, pivot with the steering front wheel.\n\nThe vast majority of rear-wheel-drive vehicles use a longitudinally mounted engine in the front of the vehicle, driving the rear wheels via a driveshaft linked via a differential between the rear axles. Some FR layout vehicles place the gearbox at the rear, though most attach it to the engine at the front.\n\nThe FR layout is often chosen for its simple design and good handling characteristics. Placing the drive wheels at the rear allows ample room for the transmission in the centre of the vehicle and avoids the mechanical complexities associated with transmitting power to the front wheels. For performance-oriented vehicles, the FR layout is more suitable than front-wheel-drive designs, especially with engines that exceed 200 horsepower. This is because weight transfers to the rear of the vehicle during acceleration, which loads the rear wheels and increases their grip.\n\nAnother advantage of the FR layout is relatively easy access to the engine compartment, a result of the longitudinal orientation of the drivetrain, as compared to the FF layout (front-engine, front-wheel drive). Powerful engines such as the inline-6 and 90° big-bore V8 are usually too long to fit in a FF transverse engine (\"east-west\") layout; the FF configuration can typically accommodate at the maximum an inline-4 or V6. This is another reason luxury/sports cars almost never use the FF layout.\n\nEven weight distribution - The layout of a rear-wheel-drive car is much closer to an even fore-and-aft weight distribution than a front-wheel-drive car, as more of the engine can lie between the front and rear wheels (in the case of a mid-engine layout, the entire engine), and the transmission is moved much farther back.[21]\n\nWeight transfer during acceleration - During heavy acceleration, weight is placed on the rear, or driving wheels, which improves traction.\n\nNo torque steer[22] (unless it\u0027s an all-wheel steer with an offset differential).\n\nRear-wheel-drive layouts\n\nFR layout\n\nRR layout\n\nCharacteristics\n\nAdvantages\n\nSteering radius - As no complicated drive shaft joints are required at the front wheels, it is possible to turn them further than would be possible using front-wheel drive, resulting in a smaller steering radius for a given wheelbase. Better handling at the hands of an expert - the more even weight distribution and weight transfer improve the handling of the car. The front and rear tyres are placed under more even loads, which allows for more grip while cornering.[23]\n\nBetter braking - the more even weight distribution helps prevent lockup from the rear wheels becoming unloaded under heavy braking.[23]\n\nTowing - Rear-wheel drive puts the wheels which are pulling the load closer to the point where a trailer articulates, helping steering, especially for large loads.[24]\n\nServiceability - Drivetrain components on a rear-wheel-drive vehicle are modular and do not involve packing as many parts into as small a space as does front-wheel drive, thus requiring less disassembly or specialized tools in order to service the vehicle.\n\nRobustness - due to geometry and packaging constraints, the universal joints attached to the wheel hub have a tendency to wear out much later than the CV joints typically used in front-wheel-drive counterparts. The significantly shorter drive axles on a front-wheel-drive car causes the joint to flex through a much wider degree of motion, compounded by additional stress and angles of steering, while the CV joints of a rear-wheel-drive car regularly see angles and wear of less than half that of front-wheel-drive vehicles.\n\nCan accommodate more powerful engines as a result of the longitudinal orientation of the drivetrain, such as the inline-6, 90° big-bore V8, V10 and V12 making the FR a common configuration for luxury and sports cars. These engines are usually too long to fit in a FF transverse engine (\"east-west\") layout; the FF configuration can typically accommodate at the maximum an inline-4 or V6.\n\nRoad grip feedback - front wheels are not afected by engine and gearbox, thus allowing for better feeling of tyre grip on road surface.\n\nUnder heavy acceleration (as in racing), oversteer and fishtailing may occur as the rear wheels break free and spin. The corrective action is to let of the throttle (this is what traction control automatically does for RWD vehicles).\n\nOn snow, ice and sand, rear-wheel drive loses its traction advantage to front- or all-wheel-drive vehicles, which have greater weight on the driven wheels. This issue is particularly noticeable on pickup trucks, as the weight of the engine and cab will significantly shift the weight from the rear to the front wheels. Rear-wheel-drive cars with rear engine or mid engine configuration do not sufer from this, although fishtailing remains an issue. To correct this situation, owners of RWD vehicles can load sandbags in the back of the vehicle (either in the bed, or boot) in order to increase the weight over the rear axle, however speeds should be restricted to correctly predicted available grip of the road.\n\nSome rear engine cars (e.g., Porsche 911) can suffer from reduced steering ability under heavy acceleration, because the engine is outside the wheelbase and at the opposite end of the car from the wheels doing the steering although the engine weight over the rear wheels provides outstanding traction and grip during acceleration. Decreased interior space - Though individual designs vary greatly, rear-wheel-drive vehicles may have: Less front leg room as the transmission tunnel takes up a space between the driver and front passenger, less leg room for centre rear passengers (due to the tunnel needed for the drive shaft), and sometimes less boot space (since there is also more hardware that must be placed underneath the boot). Rear engine designs (such as the Porsche 911 and Volkswagen Beetle) do not inherently take away interior space.\n\nA rear-wheel drive vehicle with four-wheel drive, compared to a front-wheel drive vehicle with four-wheel drive, will have a less eficient interior packaging since the transmission is often under the front passenger compartment between the two seats, whereas the latter can package all the components under the hood.[11] Increased weight - The components of a rear-wheel-drive vehicle\u0027s power train are less complex, but they are larger. The driveshaft adds weight. There is extra sheet metal to form the transmission tunnel. There is a rear xle or rear half-shafts, which are typically longer than those in a front-wheel-drive car. A rear-wheel-drive car will weigh slightly more than a comparable front-wheel-drive car (but less than four-wheel drive).\n\nRear biased weight distribution when loaded - A rear-wheel-drive car\u0027s centre of gravity is shifted rearward when heavily loaded with passengers or cargo, which may cause unpredictable handling behavior at the hands of an inexperienced driver.[4] It needs to be noted that rear engine cars are by their very nature, rear weight biased. Higher initial purchase price - Modern rear-wheel-drive vehicles are typically more expensive to purchase than comparable front-wheel-drive vehicles. Part of this can be explained by the added cost of materials and increased labor put into assembly of FR layouts, as the powertrain is not one compact unit. However, the difference is more probably explained by production volumes as most rear-wheel cars are usually in the sports/performance/luxury categories (which tend to be more upscale and/or have more powerful engines), while the FF configuration is typically in mass-produced mainstream cars.\n\nThe possibility of a slight loss in the mechanical efficiency of the drivetrain (approximately 17% coastdown losses between engine flywheel and road wheels compared to 15% for front-wheel drive - however these losses are highly\n\nDisadvantages\n\ndependent on the individual transmission). Cars with rear engine or mid engine configuration and a transverse engine layout do not sufer from this.\n\nThe long driveshaft (on front engine cars) adds to drivetrain elasticity.[4] The driveshaft must also be extended for cars with a stretched wheelbase (e.g. limousines, minivans).\n\nNote: in North America, Australia and New Zealand the term \"four-wheel drive\" usually refers only to drivetrains which are primarily two-wheel drive with a part-time four-wheel-drive capability, as typically found in pickup trucks and other off-road vehicles, while the term \"all-wheel drive\" is used to refer to full time four-wheel-drive systems found in performance cars and smaller car-based SUVs. This section uses the term four-wheel drive to refer to both.\n\nMost 4WD layouts are front-engine and are derivatives of earlier front-engine, two-wheel-drive designs. They fall into two major categories:\n\nFront-engine, rear-wheel drive derived 4WD systems, standard in most sport utility vehicles and in passenger cars, (usually referred to \"front engine, rear-wheel drive/four-wheel drive\"), forerunners of today\u0027s models include the Jensen FF, AMC Eagle and Mercedes-Benz W124 with the 4Matic system and Suzuki Grand Vitara with/without 4 mode transfer case.\n\nTransverse and longitudinal engine 4WD systems derived almost exclusively from front-engine, front-drive layouts, fitted to luxury, sporting and heavy duty segments, for example the transverse-engine Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4 and Toyota RAV4 and the longitudinal-engine Audi Quattro and most of the Subaru line.\n\nFor a full explanation of 4WD engineering considerations, see the main article on four-wheel drive.\n\nIn terms of handling, traction and performance, 4WD systems generally have most of the advantages of both front-wheel drive\n\nand rear-wheel drive. Some unique benefits are:\n\nTraction is nearly doubled compared to a two-wheel-drive layout. Given suficient power, this results in unparalleled acceleration and driveability on surfaces with less than ideal grip, and superior engine braking on loose surfaces. The development of 4WD systems for high performance cars was stimulated primarily by rallying.\n\nHandling characteristics in normal conditions can be configured to emulate FWD or RWD, or some mixture, even to switch between these behaviours according to circumstance. However, at the limit of grip, a well balanced 4WD configuration will not degenerate into either understeer or oversteer, but instead break traction of all 4 wheels at the same time into a four-wheel drift. Combined with modern electronic driving aids, this flexibility allows production car engineers a wide range of freedom in selecting handling characteristics that will allow a 4WD car to be driven more safely at higher speeds by inexpert motorists than 2WD designs.\n\n4WD systems require more machinery and complex transmission components, and so increase the manufacturing cost of the vehicle and complexity of maintenance procedures and repairs compared to 2WD designs\n\n4WD systems increase power-train mass, rotational inertia and power transmission losses, resulting in a reduction in performance in ideal dry conditions and increased fuel consumption compared to 2WD designs\n\nThe handbrake cannot be used to induce over-steer for maneuvering purposes, as the drivetrain couples the front and rear axles together. To overcome this limitation, some custom prepared stage rally cars have a special mechanism added to the transmission to disconnect the rear drive if the handbrake is applied while the car is moving.\n\nFour-wheel-drive layouts\n\nFront-engine, rear-wheel drive derived \"F4\" layout\n\nAdvantages\n\nDisadvantages\n\nUnusual 4WD layouts\n\nFrom 1989 onwards, some models of Porsche 911 feature a rear-engine 4WD layout, which is akin to a longitudinal front-engine 4WD layout installed backwards with the engine at the rear of the car\n\nFrom 2007 onwards, the Nissan GT-R features a front-engine 4WD longitudinal layout, but with the gearbox at the rear of the vehicle. This provides a more ideal weight balance, and improves directional stability at very high speeds by increasing the vehicle\u0027s moment of inertia around the vertical axis. This layout necessitates a second prop-shaft to carry power to the front wheels.\n\nSome types of farm tractors and construction site machinery use a 4WD layout where the wheels on each side are coupled together, rather than the wheels on each axle, allowing these vehicles to pivot about their centre point. Such vehicles are controlled in a fashion similar to a military tank.\n\nThe Citroën Sahara had a 4WD system using complete Citroën 2CV drivetrains at both ends of the car, such that the engine at the front powered the front wheels and the engine at the back powered the rear wheels.[25]\n\nA \u0027through the road\u0027 hybrid vehicle uses a conventional piston engine to power two wheels, with electric motor/generators on the other two wheels, giving a form of part-time 4WD.\n\nThe 2005 Jeep Hurricane concept had an all-wheel drive layout that featured two V8 engines powering a single driveshaft, with a gearbox mounted in the centre of the vehicle. The gears connected to two additional driveshafts, one on each side of the vehicle, that delivered power to the wheels via driveshaft joints.[26] This was designed in order to accommodate the vehicle\u0027s unique steering system.\n\nThe Ferrari FF features a front-engine 4WD layout in which a separate transmission is used for each pair of driven wheels,[27] rather than the more conventional setup in which a single transmission is used, followed by a centre differential or viscous coupling unit to split power between the front and rear wheels.\n\nThe first FR car was an 1895 Panhard model, so this layout was known as the \"Système Panhard\" in the early years. Most American cars used the FR layout until the mid-1980s. The Oil crisis of the 1970s and the success of small FF cars like the Mini, Volkswagen Golf, Toyota Tercel, and Honda Civic led to the widespread adoption of that layout.\n\nAfter the Arab oil embargo of 1973 and the 1979 fuel crises, a majority of American FR vehicles (station wagons, luxury sedans) were phased out for the FF layout - this trend would spawn the SUV/van conversion market. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, most American companies set as a priority the eventual removal of rear-wheel drive from their mainstream and luxury lineup.[28] Chrysler went 100% FF by 1990 and GM\u0027s American production went entirely FF by 1997 except the Firebird, Corvette and Camaro. Ford\u0027s full-size cars (the Ford Crown Victoria,\n\nMercury Grand Marquis, and Lincoln Town Car) have always been FR,[29] as was the Lincoln LS. In 2008, Hyundai introduced its own rear-wheel-drive car, the Hyundai Genesis.\n\nIn Australia, FR cars have remained popular throughout this period, with the Holden Commodore and Ford Falcon having consistently strong sales. In Europe, front-wheel drive was popularized by small cars like the Mini, Renault 5 and Volkswagen Golf and adopted for virtually all mainstream cars.\n\nUpscale marques like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Jaguar remained mostly independent of this trend, and retained a lineup mostly or entirely made up of FR cars.[30] Japanese mainstream marques such as Toyota and Nissan became mostly or entirely FF early on, while reserving for their latterly conceived luxury divisions (Lexus and Infiniti, respectively) a mostly FR lineup. While many automakers lost sight of the true sports car, Mazda introduced the highly successful Miata roadster in 1990, a true two-seater sports car using the traditional FR layout which led to other compaines such as General Motors to produce a FR sports car based on their Kappa platform.\n\nCurrently most cars are FF, including virtually all front-engine economy cars, though FR cars are making a return as an alternative to large sport-utility vehicles. In North America, GM returned to production of the FR luxury car with the 2003 Cadillac CTS, and with the removal of the DTS,[31] Cadillac will be entirely FR (with four-wheel drive available as an option on several models) by 2010, and the 2010 Camaro returns as a FR sports car. Chrysler returned its full-size cars to this layout with the Chrysler 300 and related\n\nHistory and current use\n\nFMR layout, standard in most Front-engine / Rear-wheel-drive cars pre-World War II, where the engine was located behind the front axle.\n\nmodels.[32][33] Despite Ford\u0027s 2011 discontinuation of the rear-wheel drive Panther Platform cars, they are seeking to develop a new FR replacement.[34] Nissan is also bringing back the Silvia to their line-up, Mazda is said to be releasing a new rotary-powered FR car in their RX line-up, and Toyota has produced the FT-86, an affordable RWD car which is the successor to the AE86. Hyundai introduced their affordable RWD car being the 2009 Hyundai Genesis and 2010 Hyundai Genesis Coupe.\n\nIn the 21st century, with solutions to the engineering complexities of 4WD being widely understood, and consumer demand for increasing performance in production cars, front-engine 4WD layouts are rapidly becoming more common, and most major manufacturers now offer 4WD options on at least some models. Manufacturers with a notable expertise and history in producing 4WD performance cars are Audi and Subaru.\n\nCar handling Car classification Gyrocar\n\n1.

Decreased interior space - Though individual designs vary greatly, rear-wheel-drive vehicles may have: Less front leg room as the transmission tunnel takes up a space between the driver and front passenger, less leg room for centre rear passengers (due to the tunnel needed for the drive shaft), and sometimes les\u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(automobile)\"\u003es boo\u003c/a\u003et space (since there is also more hardware that must be placed underneath the boot)\u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_engine\"\u003e.

However, at the limit of grip, a well balanced 4WD configuration will not degenerate into either understeer or oversteer, but instead break traction of all 4 wheels at the same time into a four-wheel drift. Combined with modern electronic driving aids, this flexibility allows production car engineers a wide range of freedom in selecting handling characteristics that will allow a 4WD car to be driven more safely at higher speeds by inexpert motorists than 2WD designs.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4WD systems require more machinery and complex transmission components, and so increase the manufacturing cost of the vehicle and complexity of maintenance procedures and repairs compared to 2WD designs\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4WD systems increase power-train mass, rotational inertia and power transmission losses, resulting in a reduction in performance in ideal dry conditions and increased fuel consumption compared to 2WD designs\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe handbrake cannot be used to induce over-steer for maneuvering purposes, as the drivetrain couples the front and rear axles together.

Many different combinations of engine location and driven wheels are found in practice, and the location of each is dependent on the application for which the vehicle will be used. Factors influencing the design choice include cost, complexity, reliability, packaging (location and size of the passenger compartment and boot), weight distribution, and the vehicle\u0027s intended handling characteristics.\n\nLayouts can roughly be divided into two categories: front- or rear-wheel drive. Four-wheel-drive vehicles may take on the characteristics of either, depending on how power is distributed to the wheels.\n\n1 Front-wheel-drive layouts\n\n1.1 Characteristics 1.2 Advantages 1.3 Disadvantages\n\n2 Rear-wheel-drive layouts\n\n2.1 Characteristics 2.2 Advantages 2.3 Disadvantages\n\n3 Four-wheel-drive layouts\n\n3.1 Advantages 3.2 Disadvantages 3.3 Unusual 4WD layouts\n\n4 History and current use 5 See also 6 References\n\nFront-wheel-drive layouts are those in which the front wheels of the vehicle are driven. The most popular layout used in cars today is the front-engine, front-wheel drive, with the engine in front of the front axle, driving the front wheels. This layout is typically chosen for its compact packaging; since the engine and driven wheels are on the same side of the vehicle, there is no need for a central tunnel through the passenger compartment to accommodate a prop-shaft between the engine and the driven wheels.\n\nAs the steered wheels are also the driven wheels, FF (front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout) cars are generally considered superior to FR (front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout) cars in conditions such as snow, mud, or wet tarmac. The weight of the engine over the driven wheels also improves grip in such conditions. However, powerful cars rarely\n\nContents\n\nFront-wheel-drive layouts\n\nFF layout\n\nuse the FF layout because weight transference under acceleration reduces the weight on the front wheels and reduces their traction, limiting the torque which can be utilized. Electronic traction control can avoid wheelspin but largely negates the benefit of extra torque/power.\n\nA transverse engine (also known as \"east-west\") is commonly used in FF designs, in contrast to FR which uses a longitudinal engine. The FF layout also restricts the size of the engine that can be placed in modern engine compartments, as FF configurations usually have inline-4 and V6 engines, while longer engines such as inline-6 and 90° V8 will rarely fit. This is another reason luxury/sports cars avoid the FF layout. Exceptions do exist, such as the Volvo S80 (FWD/4WD) which uses transversely mounted inline-6 and V8 engines, and the Ford Taurus SHO, available with a 60° V8 and front-wheel drive.\n\nFront-wheel drive gives more interior space since the powertrain is a single unit contained in the engine compartment of the vehicle and there is no need to devote interior space for a driveshaft tunnel or rear differential, increasing the volume available for passengers and cargo.[1] There are some exceptions to this as rear engine designs do not take away interior space (see Porsche 911, and Volkswagen Beetle). It also has fewer components overall and thus lower weight.[1] The direct connection between engine and transaxle reduces the mass and mechanical inertia of the drivetrain compared to a rear-wheel-drive vehicle with a similar engine and transmission, allowing greater fuel economy.[1] In front-wheel-drive cars the mass of the drivetrain is placed over the driven wheels and thus moves the centre of gravity farther forward than a comparable rear-wheel-drive layout, improving traction and directional stability on wet, snowy, or icy surfaces.[1][2][3] Front-wheel-drive cars, with a front weight bias, tend to understeer at the limit which, according to Saab engineer Gunnar Larsson, is easier since it makes instinct correct in avoiding terminal oversteer, and less prone to result in fishtailing or a spin.[3][4]\n\nAccording to a sales brochure for the 1989 Lotus Elan, the ride and handling engineers at Lotus found that \"for a given vehicle weight, power and tyre size, a front-wheel-drive car was always faster over a given section of road.\"[5] However, this may only apply for cars with moderate power-to-weight ratio.[2][6][7] According to road test with two Dodge Daytonas, one FWD and one RWD, the road layout is also important for what configuration is the fastest.[3]\n\nWeight shifting limits the acceleration of a front-wheel-drive vehicle. During heavy acceleration, weight is shifted to the back, improving traction at the rear wheels at the expense of the front driving wheels; consequently, most racing cars are rear-wheel drive for acceleration. However, since front-wheel-drive cars have the weight of the engine over the driving wheels, the problem only applies in extreme conditions in which case the car understeers. On snow, ice, and sand, rear-wheel drive loses its traction advantage to front or all-wheel-drive vehicles which have greater weight over the driven wheels. Rear-wheel-drive cars with rear engine or mid engine configuration retain traction over the driven wheels, although fishtailing remains an issue on hard acceleration while in a turn. Some rear engine cars (e.g., Porsche 911) can suffer from reduced steering ability under heavy acceleration, since the engine is outside the wheelbase and at the opposite end of the car from the wheels doing the steering. A rear-wheel-drive car\u0027s centre of gravity is shifted rearward when heavily loaded with passengers or cargo, which may cause unpredictable handling behavior.[4]\n\nOn front-wheel-drive cars, the short driveshaft may reduce drivetrain elasticity, improving responsiveness.[4]\n\nInterior space: Since the powertrain is a single unit contained in the engine compartment of the vehicle, there is no need to devote interior space for a driveshaft tunnel or rear differential, increasing the volume available for passengers and cargo.[1]\n\nInstead, the tunnel may be used to route the exhaust system pipes. Weight: Fewer components usually means lower weight. Improved fuel efficiency due to less weight.[8]\n\nCost: Fewer material components and less installation complexity overall. However, the considerable MSRP differential between a FF and FR car cannot be attributed to layout alone. The difference is more probably explained by production volumes as most rear-wheel cars are usually in the sports/performance/luxury categories (which tend to be more upscale and/or have more powerful engines), while the FF configuration is typically in mass-produced\n\nCharacteristics\n\nAdvantages\n\nmainstream cars. Few modern \"family\" cars have rear-wheel drive as of 2009, so a direct cost comparison is not necessarily possible. A contrast could be somewhat drawn between the Audi A4 FrontTrak (which has an FF layout and front-wheel drive) and a rear-wheel-drive BMW 3 Series (which is FR), both which are in the compact executive car classification and use longitudinally mounted engines.[1]\n\nImproved drivetrain eficiency: the direct connection between engine and transaxle reduce the mass and mechanical inertia of the drivetrain compared to a rear-wheel-drive vehicle with a similar engine and transmission, allowing greater fuel economy.[1]\n\nAssembly efficiency: the powertrain can often be assembled and installed as a unit, which allows more efficient production.\n\nPlacing the mass of the drivetrain over the driven wheels moves the centre of gravity farther forward than a comparable rear-wheel-drive layout, improving traction and directional stability on wet, snowy, or icy surfaces.[1][2][3] Predictable handling characteristics: front-wheel-drive cars, with a front weight bias, tend to understeer at the limit, which (according to SAAB engineer Gunnar Larsson) is easier since it makes instinct correct in avoiding terminal oversteer, and less prone to result in fishtailing or a spin.[3][4]\n\nA skilled driver can control the movement of the car even while skidding by steering, throttling and pulling the hand brake (given that the hand brake operates the rear wheels as in most cases, with some Citroen and Saab models being notable exceptions).\n\nIt is easier to correct trailing-throttle or trailing-brake oversteer.[3]\n\nThe wheelbase can be extended without building a longer driveshaft (as with rear-wheel-driven cars).\n\nFront-engine front-wheel-drive layouts are \"nose heavy\" with more weight distribution forward, which makes them prone to understeer, especially in high horsepower applications.\n\nIf a front-engine front-wheel-drive layout is fitted with a four-wheel-drive, plus enthusiast driver aids, such as active front differential, active steering, and ultra-quick electrically adjustable shocks, this somewhat negate the understeer problem and allow the car to perform as well as a front-engine rear-wheel-drive car. These trick differentials, which are found on the Acura TL SH-AWD and Audi S4 3.0 TFSI quattro, and Audi RS5 4.2 FSI quattro, are heavy, complex, and expensive.[9][10] While these aids do tame front end plow, cars fitted with these systems are still at a disadvantage when track tested against rear-wheel drive vehicles (including those with added four-wheel drive[11]).[12]\n\nTorque steer is the tendency for some front-wheel-drive cars to pull to the left or right under hard acceleration. It is a result of the offset between the point about which the wheel steers (it is aligned with the points where the wheel is connected to the steering mechanisms) and the centroid of its contact patch. The tractive force acts through the centroid of the contact patch, and the offset of the steering point means that a turning moment about the axis of steering is generated. In an ideal situation, the left and right wheels would generate equal and opposite moments, canceling each other out; however, in reality, this is less likely to happen. Torque steer can be addressed by using a longitudinal layout, equal length drive shafts, half shafts, a multilink suspension or centre-point steering geometry.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19]\n\nIn a vehicle, the weight shifts back during acceleration, giving more traction to the rear wheels. This is one of the main reasons nearly all racing cars are rear-wheel drive. However, since front-wheel-drive cars have the weight of the engine over the driving wheels, the problem only applies in extreme conditions such as attempting to accelerate up a wet hill or attempting to beat another RWD car off the line.\n\nIn some towing situations, front-wheel-drive cars can be at a traction disadvantage since there will be less weight on the driving wheels. Because of this, the weight that the vehicle is rated to safely tow is likely to be less than that of a rear-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive vehicle of the same size and power.\n\nDue to geometry and packaging constraints, the CV joints (constant-velocity joints) attached to the wheel hub have a tendency to wear out much earlier than the universal joints typically used in their rear-wheel-drive counterparts (although rear-wheel-drive vehicles with independent rear suspension also employ CV joints and half-shafts). The significantly shorter drive axles on a front-wheel-drive car causes the joint to flex through a much wider degree of motion, compounded by additional stress and angles of steering, while the CV joints of a rear-wheel-drive car regularly see angles and wear of less than half that of front-wheel-drive vehicles.\n\nTurning circle - FF layouts almost always use a transverse engine (\"east-west\") installation, which limits the amount by which the front wheels can turn, thus increasing the turning circle of a front-wheel-drive car compared to a rear-wheel-drive one with the same wheelbase. A notable example is the original Mini. It is widely misconceived that this limitation is due to a limit on the angle at which a CV joint can be operated, but this is easily disproved by considering the turning circle of car models that use a longitudinal FF or F4 layout from Audi and (prior to 1992) Saab.\n\nThe FF transverse engine layout (also known as \"east-west\") restricts the size of the engine that can be placed in modern engine compartments, so it is rarely adopted by powerful luxury and sports cars. FF configurations can usually only accommodate inline-4 and V6 engines, while longer engines such as inline-6 and 90° big-bore V8 will rarely fit, though there are exceptions. One way around this problem is using a staggered engine.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nIt makes heavier use of the front tyres (i.e., accelerating, braking, and turning), causing more wear in the front than in a rear-wheel-drive layout.\n\nUnder extreme braking (like for instance in a panic stop), the already front heavy layout further reduces traction to the rear wheels. This results in disproportionate gripping forces focused at the front while the rear does not have enough weight to efectively use its brakes. Because the rear tyres\u0027 capabilities in braking are not very high, a significant number of cheaper front drive vehicles use drum brakes in the rear even today.\n\nThe steering \u0027feel\u0027 is more numbed than a RWD car. This is due to the extra weight of drive shafts and CV joint components that increase unsprung weight.\n\nRear-wheel drive (RWD) typically places the engine in the front of the vehicle and the driven wheels are located at the rear, a configuration known as front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout (FR layout). The front mid-engine, rear mid-engine and rear engine layouts are also used. This was the traditional automobile layout for most vehicles up until the 1970s and 1980s.[20] Nearly all motorcycles and bicycles use rear-wheel drive as well, either by driveshaft, chain, or belt, since the front wheel is turned for steering, and it would be very difficult and cumbersome to \"bend\" the drive mechanism around the turn of the front wheel. A relatively rare exception is with the \u0027moving bottom bracket\u0027 type of recumbent bicycle, where the entire drivetrain, including pedals and chain, pivot with the steering front wheel.\n\nThe vast majority of rear-wheel-drive vehicles use a longitudinally mounted engine in the front of the vehicle, driving the rear wheels via a driveshaft linked via a differential between the rear axles. Some FR layout vehicles place the gearbox at the rear, though most attach it to the engine at the front.\n\nThe FR layout is often chosen for its simple design and good handling characteristics. Placing the drive wheels at the rear allows ample room for the transmission in the centre of the vehicle and avoids the mechanical complexities associated with transmitting power to the front wheels. For performance-oriented vehicles, the FR layout is more suitable than front-wheel-drive designs, especially with engines that exceed 200 horsepower. This is because weight transfers to the rear of the vehicle during acceleration, which loads the rear wheels and increases their grip.\n\nAnother advantage of the FR layout is relatively easy access to the engine compartment, a result of the longitudinal orientation of the drivetrain, as compared to the FF layout (front-engine, front-wheel drive). Powerful engines such as the inline-6 and 90° big-bore V8 are usually too long to fit in a FF transverse engine (\"east-west\") layout; the FF configuration can typically accommodate at the maximum an inline-4 or V6. This is another reason luxury/sports cars almost never use the FF layout.\n\nEven weight distribution - The layout of a rear-wheel-drive car is much closer to an even fore-and-aft weight distribution than a front-wheel-drive car, as more of the engine can lie between the front and rear wheels (in the case of a mid-engine layout, the entire engine), and the transmission is moved much farther back.[21]\n\nWeight transfer during acceleration - During heavy acceleration, weight is placed on the rear, or driving wheels, which improves traction.\n\nNo torque steer[22] (unless it\u0027s an all-wheel steer with an offset differential).\n\nRear-wheel-drive layouts\n\nFR layout\n\nRR layout\n\nCharacteristics\n\nAdvantages\n\nSteering radius - As no complicated drive shaft joints are required at the front wheels, it is possible to turn them further than would be possible using front-wheel drive, resulting in a smaller steering radius for a given wheelbase. Better handling at the hands of an expert - the more even weight distribution and weight transfer improve the handling of the car. The front and rear tyres are placed under more even loads, which allows for more grip while cornering.[23]\n\nBetter braking - the more even weight distribution helps prevent lockup from the rear wheels becoming unloaded under heavy braking.[23]\n\nTowing - Rear-wheel drive puts the wheels which are pulling the load closer to the point where a trailer articulates, helping steering, especially for large loads.[24]\n\nServiceability - Drivetrain components on a rear-wheel-drive vehicle are modular and do not involve packing as many parts into as small a space as does front-wheel drive, thus requiring less disassembly or specialized tools in order to service the vehicle.\n\nRobustness - due to geometry and packaging constraints, the universal joints attached to the wheel hub have a tendency to wear out much later than the CV joints typically used in front-wheel-drive counterparts. The significantly shorter drive axles on a front-wheel-drive car causes the joint to flex through a much wider degree of motion, compounded by additional stress and angles of steering, while the CV joints of a rear-wheel-drive car regularly see angles and wear of less than half that of front-wheel-drive vehicles.\n\nCan accommodate more powerful engines as a result of the longitudinal orientation of the drivetrain, such as the inline-6, 90° big-bore V8, V10 and V12 making the FR a common configuration for luxury and sports cars. These engines are usually too long to fit in a FF transverse engine (\"east-west\") layout; the FF configuration can typically accommodate at the maximum an inline-4 or V6.\n\nRoad grip feedback - front wheels are not afected by engine and gearbox, thus allowing for better feeling of tyre grip on road surface.\n\nUnder heavy acceleration (as in racing), oversteer and fishtailing may occur as the rear wheels break free and spin. The corrective action is to let of the throttle (this is what traction control automatically does for RWD vehicles).\n\nOn snow, ice and sand, rear-wheel drive loses its traction advantage to front- or all-wheel-drive vehicles, which have greater weight on the driven wheels. This issue is particularly noticeable on pickup trucks, as the weight of the engine and cab will significantly shift the weight from the rear to the front wheels. Rear-wheel-drive cars with rear engine or mid engine configuration do not sufer from this, although fishtailing remains an issue. To correct this situation, owners of RWD vehicles can load sandbags in the back of the vehicle (either in the bed, or boot) in order to increase the weight over the rear axle, however speeds should be restricted to correctly predicted available grip of the road.\n\nSome rear engine cars (e.g., Porsche 911) can suffer from reduced steering ability under heavy acceleration, because the engine is outside the wheelbase and at the opposite end of the car from the wheels doing the steering although the engine weight over the rear wheels provides outstanding traction and grip during acceleration. Decreased interior space - Though individual designs vary greatly, rear-wheel-drive vehicles may have: Less front leg room as the transmission tunnel takes up a space between the driver and front passenger, less leg room for centre rear passengers (due to the tunnel needed for the drive shaft), and sometimes less boot space (since there is also more hardware that must be placed underneath the boot). Rear engine designs (such as the Porsche 911 and Volkswagen Beetle) do not inherently take away interior space.\n\nA rear-wheel drive vehicle with four-wheel drive, compared to a front-wheel drive vehicle with four-wheel drive, will have a less eficient interior packaging since the transmission is often under the front passenger compartment between the two seats, whereas the latter can package all the components under the hood.[11] Increased weight - The components of a rear-wheel-drive vehicle\u0027s power train are less complex, but they are larger. The driveshaft adds weight. There is extra sheet metal to form the transmission tunnel. There is a rear xle or rear half-shafts, which are typically longer than those in a front-wheel-drive car. A rear-wheel-drive car will weigh slightly more than a comparable front-wheel-drive car (but less than four-wheel drive).\n\nRear biased weight distribution when loaded - A rear-wheel-drive car\u0027s centre of gravity is shifted rearward when heavily loaded with passengers or cargo, which may cause unpredictable handling behavior at the hands of an inexperienced driver.[4] It needs to be noted that rear engine cars are by their very nature, rear weight biased. Higher initial purchase price - Modern rear-wheel-drive vehicles are typically more expensive to purchase than comparable front-wheel-drive vehicles. Part of this can be explained by the added cost of materials and increased labor put into assembly of FR layouts, as the powertrain is not one compact unit. However, the difference is more probably explained by production volumes as most rear-wheel cars are usually in the sports/performance/luxury categories (which tend to be more upscale and/or have more powerful engines), while the FF configuration is typically in mass-produced mainstream cars.\n\nThe possibility of a slight loss in the mechanical efficiency of the drivetrain (approximately 17% coastdown losses between engine flywheel and road wheels compared to 15% for front-wheel drive - however these losses are highly\n\nDisadvantages\n\ndependent on the individual transmission). Cars with rear engine or mid engine configuration and a transverse engine layout do not sufer from this.\n\nThe long driveshaft (on front engine cars) adds to drivetrain elasticity.[4] The driveshaft must also be extended for cars with a stretched wheelbase (e.g. limousines, minivans).\n\nNote: in North America, Australia and New Zealand the term \"four-wheel drive\" usually refers only to drivetrains which are primarily two-wheel drive with a part-time four-wheel-drive capability, as typically found in pickup trucks and other off-road vehicles, while the term \"all-wheel drive\" is used to refer to full time four-wheel-drive systems found in performance cars and smaller car-based SUVs. This section uses the term four-wheel drive to refer to both.\n\nMost 4WD layouts are front-engine and are derivatives of earlier front-engine, two-wheel-drive designs. They fall into two major categories:\n\nFront-engine, rear-wheel drive derived 4WD systems, standard in most sport utility vehicles and in passenger cars, (usually referred to \"front engine, rear-wheel drive/four-wheel drive\"), forerunners of today\u0027s models include the Jensen FF, AMC Eagle and Mercedes-Benz W124 with the 4Matic system and Suzuki Grand Vitara with/without 4 mode transfer case.\n\nTransverse and longitudinal engine 4WD systems derived almost exclusively from front-engine, front-drive layouts, fitted to luxury, sporting and heavy duty segments, for example the transverse-engine Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4 and Toyota RAV4 and the longitudinal-engine Audi Quattro and most of the Subaru line.\n\nFor a full explanation of 4WD engineering considerations, see the main article on four-wheel drive.\n\nIn terms of handling, traction and performance, 4WD systems generally have most of the advantages of both front-wheel drive\n\nand rear-wheel drive. Some unique benefits are:\n\nTraction is nearly doubled compared to a two-wheel-drive layout. Given suficient power, this results in unparalleled acceleration and driveability on surfaces with less than ideal grip, and superior engine braking on loose surfaces. The development of 4WD systems for high performance cars was stimulated primarily by rallying.\n\nHandling characteristics in normal conditions can be configured to emulate FWD or RWD, or some mixture, even to switch between these behaviours according to circumstance. However, at the limit of grip, a well balanced 4WD configuration will not degenerate into either understeer or oversteer, but instead break traction of all 4 wheels at the same time into a four-wheel drift. Combined with modern electronic driving aids, this flexibility allows production car engineers a wide range of freedom in selecting handling characteristics that will allow a 4WD car to be driven more safely at higher speeds by inexpert motorists than 2WD designs.\n\n4WD systems require more machinery and complex transmission components, and so increase the manufacturing cost of the vehicle and complexity of maintenance procedures and repairs compared to 2WD designs\n\n4WD systems increase power-train mass, rotational inertia and power transmission losses, resulting in a reduction in performance in ideal dry conditions and increased fuel consumption compared to 2WD designs\n\nThe handbrake cannot be used to induce over-steer for maneuvering purposes, as the drivetrain couples the front and rear axles together. To overcome this limitation, some custom prepared stage rally cars have a special mechanism added to the transmission to disconnect the rear drive if the handbrake is applied while the car is moving.\n\nFour-wheel-drive layouts\n\nFront-engine, rear-wheel drive derived \"F4\" layout\n\nAdvantages\n\nDisadvantages\n\nUnusual 4WD layouts\n\nFrom 1989 onwards, some models of Porsche 911 feature a rear-engine 4WD layout, which is akin to a longitudinal front-engine 4WD layout installed backwards with the engine at the rear of the car\n\nFrom 2007 onwards, the Nissan GT-R features a front-engine 4WD longitudinal layout, but with the gearbox at the rear of the vehicle. This provides a more ideal weight balance, and improves directional stability at very high speeds by increasing the vehicle\u0027s moment of inertia around the vertical axis. This layout necessitates a second prop-shaft to carry power to the front wheels.\n\nSome types of farm tractors and construction site machinery use a 4WD layout where the wheels on each side are coupled together, rather than the wheels on each axle, allowing these vehicles to pivot about their centre point. Such vehicles are controlled in a fashion similar to a military tank.\n\nThe Citroën Sahara had a 4WD system using complete Citroën 2CV drivetrains at both ends of the car, such that the engine at the front powered the front wheels and the engine at the back powered the rear wheels.[25]\n\nA \u0027through the road\u0027 hybrid vehicle uses a conventional piston engine to power two wheels, with electric motor/generators on the other two wheels, giving a form of part-time 4WD.\n\nThe 2005 Jeep Hurricane concept had an all-wheel drive layout that featured two V8 engines powering a single driveshaft, with a gearbox mounted in the centre of the vehicle. The gears connected to two additional driveshafts, one on each side of the vehicle, that delivered power to the wheels via driveshaft joints.[26] This was designed in order to accommodate the vehicle\u0027s unique steering system.\n\nThe Ferrari FF features a front-engine 4WD layout in which a separate transmission is used for each pair of driven wheels,[27] rather than the more conventional setup in which a single transmission is used, followed by a centre differential or viscous coupling unit to split power between the front and rear wheels.\n\nThe first FR car was an 1895 Panhard model, so this layout was known as the \"Système Panhard\" in the early years. Most American cars used the FR layout until the mid-1980s. The Oil crisis of the 1970s and the success of small FF cars like the Mini, Volkswagen Golf, Toyota Tercel, and Honda Civic led to the widespread adoption of that layout.\n\nAfter the Arab oil embargo of 1973 and the 1979 fuel crises, a majority of American FR vehicles (station wagons, luxury sedans) were phased out for the FF layout - this trend would spawn the SUV/van conversion market. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, most American companies set as a priority the eventual removal of rear-wheel drive from their mainstream and luxury lineup.[28] Chrysler went 100% FF by 1990 and GM\u0027s American production went entirely FF by 1997 except the Firebird, Corvette and Camaro. Ford\u0027s full-size cars (the Ford Crown Victoria,\n\nMercury Grand Marquis, and Lincoln Town Car) have always been FR,[29] as was the Lincoln LS. In 2008, Hyundai introduced its own rear-wheel-drive car, the Hyundai Genesis.\n\nIn Australia, FR cars have remained popular throughout this period, with the Holden Commodore and Ford Falcon having consistently strong sales. In Europe, front-wheel drive was popularized by small cars like the Mini, Renault 5 and Volkswagen Golf and adopted for virtually all mainstream cars.\n\nUpscale marques like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Jaguar remained mostly independent of this trend, and retained a lineup mostly or entirely made up of FR cars.[30] Japanese mainstream marques such as Toyota and Nissan became mostly or entirely FF early on, while reserving for their latterly conceived luxury divisions (Lexus and Infiniti, respectively) a mostly FR lineup. While many automakers lost sight of the true sports car, Mazda introduced the highly successful Miata roadster in 1990, a true two-seater sports car using the traditional FR layout which led to other compaines such as General Motors to produce a FR sports car based on their Kappa platform.\n\nCurrently most cars are FF, including virtually all front-engine economy cars, though FR cars are making a return as an alternative to large sport-utility vehicles. In North America, GM returned to production of the FR luxury car with the 2003 Cadillac CTS, and with the removal of the DTS,[31] Cadillac will be entirely FR (with four-wheel drive available as an option on several models) by 2010, and the 2010 Camaro returns as a FR sports car. Chrysler returned its full-size cars to this layout with the Chrysler 300 and related\n\nHistory and current use\n\nFMR layout, standard in most Front-engine / Rear-wheel-drive cars pre-World War II, where the engine was located behind the front axle.\n\nmodels.[32][33] Despite Ford\u0027s 2011 discontinuation of the rear-wheel drive Panther Platform cars, they are seeking to develop a new FR replacement.[34] Nissan is also bringing back the Silvia to their line-up, Mazda is said to be releasing a new rotary-powered FR car in their RX line-up, and Toyota has produced the FT-86, an affordable RWD car which is the successor to the AE86. Hyundai introduced their affordable RWD car being the 2009 Hyundai Genesis and 2010 Hyundai Genesis Coupe.\n\nIn the 21st century, with solutions to the engineering complexities of 4WD being widely understood, and consumer demand for increasing performance in production cars, front-engine 4WD layouts are rapidly becoming more common, and most major manufacturers now offer 4WD options on at least some models. Manufacturers with a notable expertise and history in producing 4WD performance cars are Audi and Subaru.\n\nCar handling Car classification Gyrocar\n\n1.

suspension. For information on two-wheeled vehicles\u0027 suspensions see the motorcycle suspension, motorcycle fork, bicycle suspension, and bicycle fork articles.\n\nSuspension is the system of tires, tire air, springs, shock absorbers and linkages that connects a vehicle to its wheels and allows relative motion between the two.[1] Suspension systems must support both roadholding/handling and ride quality,[2] which are at odds with each other. The tuning of suspensions involves finding the right compromise. It is important for the suspension to keep the road wheel in contact with the road surface as much as possible, because all the road or ground forces acting on the vehicle do so through the contact patches of the tires. The suspension also protects the vehicle itself and any cargo or luggage from damage and wear. The design of front and rear suspension of a car may be different.\n\n1 History\n\n2 Difference between rear suspension and front suspension\n\n2.1 History\n\n3 Spring, wheel, and roll rates\n\n3.1 Spring rate\n\n3.1.1 Mathematics of the spring rate 3.2 Wheel rate 3.3 Roll rate\n\n3.4 Roll couple percentage\n\n4 Weight transfer\n\n4.1 Unsprung weight transfer 4.2 Sprung weight transfer 4.3 Jacking forces\n\n5 Other properties\n\n5.1 Travel 5.2 Damping 5.3 Camber control\n\n5.4 Roll center height\n\n5.5 Instant center\n\n6 Variations in suspension design\n\n6.1 Anti-dive and anti-squat 6.2\n\nFlexibility and vibration modes of the suspension elements 6.3 Load levelling\n\n6.4 Isolation from high frequency shock\n\n6.5 Contribution to unsprung weight and total weight 6.6 Space occupied 6.7 Force distribution 6.8 Air resistance (drag)\n\n6.9 Cost\n\nThe front suspension components of a Ford Model T.\n\nThe rear suspension on a truck: a leaf spring.\n\nContents\n\n7 Springs and dampers\n\n7.1 Passive suspensions 7.1.1 Springs\n\n7.1.2 Dampers or shock absorbers 7.2 Semi-active and active suspensions 7.3 Interconnected suspensions\n\n8 Suspension geometry\n\n8.1 Dependent suspensions 8.2 Independent suspensions 8.3 Semi-independent suspension\n\n9 Tilting Suspension System 10 Rocker bogie mechanism 11 Tracked vehicles\n\n12 Armoured fighting vehicle suspension\n\n13 See also\n\n14 References\n\n15 External links\n\nAn early form of suspension on ox-drawn carts had the platform swing on iron chains attached to the wheeled frame of the carriage. This system remained the basis for all suspension systems until the turn of the 19th century, although the iron chains were replaced with the use of leather straps by the 17th century. No modern automobiles use the \u0027strap suspension\u0027 system.\n\nAutomobiles were initially developed as self-propelled versions of horse-drawn vehicles. However, horse-drawn vehicles had been designed for relatively slow speeds, and their suspension was not well suited to the higher speeds permitted by the internal combustion engine.\n\nThe first workable spring-suspension required advanced metallurgical knowledge and skill, and only became possible with the advent of industrialisation. Obadiah Elliott registered the first patent for a spring-suspension vehicle; - each wheel had two durable steel leaf springs on each side and the body of the carriage was fixed directly to the springs which were attached to the axles. Within a decade, most British horse carriages were equipped with springs; wooden springs in the case of light one-horse vehicles to avoid taxation, and steel springs in larger vehicles. These were often made of low-carbon steel and usually took the form of multiple layer leaf springs.[3]\n\nLeaf springs have been around since the early Egyptians. Ancient military engineers used leaf springs in the form of bows to power their siege engines, with little success at first. The use of leaf springs in catapults was later refined and made to work years later. Springs were not only made of metal, a sturdy tree branch could be used as a spring, such as with a bow. Horse-drawn carriages and the Ford Model T used this system, and it is still used today in larger vehicles, mainly mounted in the rear suspension.[4]\n\nPart of car front suspension and steering mechanism: tie rod, steering arm, king pin axis (using ball joints).\n\nVan Diemen RF01 Racing Car Suspension.\n\nHistory\n\nStrap suspension 1605\n\nStrap suspension 2008 note the transverse limiting straps\n\nThis was the first modern suspension system and, along with advances in the construction of roads, heralded the single greatest improvement in road transport until the advent of the automobile.[5] The British steel springs were not well suited for use on America\u0027s rough roads of the time, so the Abbot-Downing Company of Concord, New Hampshire re-introduced leather strap suspension, which gave a swinging motion instead of the jolting up and down of a spring suspension.\n\nIn 1901 Mors of Paris first fitted an automobile with shock absorbers. With the advantage of a damped suspension system on his \u0027Mors Machine\u0027, Henri Fournier won the prestigious Paris-to-Berlin race on 20 June 1901. Fournier\u0027s superior time was 11 hrs 46 min 10 sec, while the best competitor was Léonce Girardot in a Panhard with a time of 12 hrs 15 min 40 sec.[6]\n\nCoil springs first appeared on a production vehicle in 1906 in the Brush Runabout made by the Brush Motor Company. Today, coil springs are used in most cars.\n\nIn 1920, Leyland Motors used torsion bars in a suspension system.\n\nIn 1922, independent front suspension was pioneered on the Lancia Lambda and became more common in mass market cars from 1932.[7] Today most cars have independent suspension on all four wheels.\n\nIn 2002, a new passive suspension component was invented by Malcolm C. Smith, the inerter. This has the ability to increase the effective inertia of a wheel suspension using a geared flywheel, but without adding significant mass. It was initially employed in Formula 1 in secrecy but has since spread to other motorsport.\n\nObviously any four wheel vehicle needs suspension for both the front wheels and the rear suspension, but in two wheel drive vehicles these can be very different configuration. For front-wheel drive cars, rear suspension has few constraints and a variety of beam axles and independent suspensions are used. For rear-wheel drive cars, rear suspension has many constraints and the development of the superior but more expensive independent suspension layout has been difficult. Four-wheel drive often have suspensions that are similar for both the front and rear wheels.\n\nHenry Ford\u0027s Model T used a torque tube to restrain this force, for his differential was attached to the chassis by a lateral leaf spring and two narrow rods. The torque tube surrounded the true driveshaft and exerted the force to its ball joint at the extreme rear of the transmission, which was attached to the engine. A similar method was used by the late-1930s Buick and by Hudson\u0027s bathtub car of 1948, which used helical springs which could not take fore-and-aft thrust.\n\nThe Hotchkiss drive, invented by Albert Hotchkiss, was the most popular rear suspension system used in American cars from the 1930s to the 1970s. The system uses longitudinal leaf springs attached both forward and behind the differential of the live axle. These springs transmit the torque to the frame. Although scorned by many European car makers of the time, it was accepted by American car makers because it was inexpensive to manufacture. Also, the dynamic defects of this design were suppressed by the enormous weight of US passenger vehicles before implementation of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard.\n\nAnother Frenchman invented the De Dion tube, which is sometimes called \"semi-independent\". Like a true independent rear suspension, this employs two universal joints or their equivalent from the center of the differential to each wheel. But the wheels cannot entirely rise and fall independently of each other; they are tied by a yoke that goes around the differential, below and behind it. This method has had little use in the United States, though it does not evidence the bump steer that a more expensive, true independent suspension does. Its use around 1900 was probably due to the poor quality of tires, which wore out quickly. By removing a good deal of unsprung weight, as independent rear suspensions do, it made them last longer.\n\nHenri Fournier on his uniquely damped and racewinning \u0027Mors Machine\u0027, photo taken 1902\n\nDifference between rear suspension and front suspension\n\nHistory\n\nRear wheel drive vehicles today frequently use a fairly complex fully independent, multi-link suspension to locate the rear wheels securely while providing decent ride quality.\n\nThe spring rate (or suspension rate) is a component in setting the vehicle\u0027s ride height or its location in the suspension stroke. When a spring is compressed or stretched, the force it exerts is proportional to its change in length. The spring rate or spring constant of a spring is the change in the force it exerts, divided by the change in deflection of the spring. Vehicles which carry heavy loads will often have heavier springs to compensate for the additional weight that would otherwise collapse a vehicle to the bottom of its travel (stroke). Heavier springs are also used in performance applications where the loading conditions experienced are more extreme.\n\nSprings that are too hard or too soft cause the suspension to become ineffective because they fail to properly isolate the vehicle from the road. Vehicles that commonly experience suspension loads heavier than normal have heavy or hard springs with a spring rate close to the upper limit for that vehicle\u0027s weight. This allows the vehicle to perform properly under a heavy load when control is limited by the inertia of the load. Riding in an empty truck used for carrying loads can be uncomfortable for passengers because of its high spring rate relative to the weight of the vehicle. A race car would also be described as having heavy springs and would also be uncomfortably bumpy. However, even though we say they both have heavy springs, the actual spring rates for a 2,000 lb (910 kg) race car and a 10,000 lb (4,500 kg) truck are very different. A luxury car, taxi, or passenger bus would be described as having soft springs. Vehicles with worn out or damaged springs ride lower to the ground which reduces the overall amount of compression available to the suspension and increases the amount of body lean. Performance vehicles can sometimes have spring rate requirements other than vehicle weight and load.\n\nSpring rate is a ratio used to measure how resistant a spring is to being compressed or expanded during the spring\u0027s deflection. The magnitude of the spring force increases as deflection increases according to Hooke\u0027s Law. Briefly, this can be stated as\n\nwhere\n\nF\n\nis the force the spring exerts\n\nk\n\nis the spring rate of the spring.\n\nx is the deflection of the spring from its equilibrium position (i.e., when no force is applied on the spring)\n\nNegative sign indicates direction of applied force and force exerted by spring are opposite. Spring rate is confined to a narrow interval by the weight of the vehicle, load the vehicle will carry, and to a lesser extent by suspension geometry and performance desires.\n\nSpring rates typically have units of N/mm (or lbf/in). An example of a linear spring rate is 500 lbf/in. For every inch the spring is compressed, it exerts 500 lbf. A non-linear spring rate is one for which the relation between the spring\u0027s compression and the force exerted cannot be fitted adequately to a linear model. For example, the first inch exerts 500 lbf force, the second inch exerts an additional 550 lbf (for a total of 1050 lbf), the third inch exerts another 600 lbf (for a total of 1650 lbf). In contrast a 500 lbf/in linear spring compressed to 3 inches will only exert 1500 lbf.\n\nSpring, wheel, and roll rates\n\nCitroën BX Hydropneumatic suspension - maximum to minimum demonstration Play media\n\nSpring rate\n\nMathematics of the spring rate\n\nThe spring rate of a coil spring may be calculated by a simple algebraic equation or it may be measured in a spring testing machine. The spring constant k can be calculated as follows:\n\nwhere d is the wire diameter, G is the spring\u0027s shear modulus (e.g., about 12,000,000 lbf/in² or 80 GPa for steel), N is the number of wraps and D is the diameter of the coil.\n\nWheel rate is the effective spring rate when measured at the wheel. This is as opposed to simply measuring the spring rate alone.\n\nWheel rate is usually equal to or considerably less than the spring rate. Commonly, springs are mounted on control arms, swing arms or some other pivoting suspension member. Consider the example above where the spring rate was calculated to be 500 lbs/inch (87.5 N/mm), if you were to move the wheel 1 in (2.5 cm) (without moving the car), the spring more than likely compresses a smaller amount. Let\u0027s assume the spring moved 0.75 in (19 mm), the lever arm ratio would be 0.75:1. The wheel rate is calculated by taking the square of the ratio (0.5625) times the spring rate, thus obtaining 281.25 lbs/inch (49.25 N/mm). Squaring the ratio is because the ratio has two effects on the wheel rate. The ratio applies to both the force and distance traveled.\n\nWheel rate on independent suspension is fairly straightforward. However, special consideration must be taken with some non-independent suspension designs. Take the case of the straight axle. When viewed from the front or rear, the wheel rate can be measured by the means above. Yet because the wheels are not independent, when viewed from the side under acceleration or braking the pivot point is at infinity (because both wheels have moved) and the spring is directly inline with the wheel contact patch. The result is often that the effective wheel rate under cornering is different from what it is under acceleration and braking. This variation in wheel rate may be minimized by locating the spring as close to the wheel as possible.\n\nWheel rates are usually summed and compared with the sprung mass of a vehicle to create a \"ride rate\" and corresponding suspension natural frequency in ride (also referred to as \"heave\"). This can be useful in creating a metric for suspension stiffness and travel requirements for a vehicle.\n\nRoll rate is analogous to a vehicle\u0027s ride rate, but for actions that include lateral accelerations, causing a vehicle\u0027s sprung mass to roll about its roll axis. It is expressed as torque per degree of roll of the vehicle sprung mass. It is influenced by factors including but not limited to vehicle sprung mass, track width, CG height, spring and damper rates, roll center heights of front and rear, anti-roll bar stiffness and tire pressure/construction. The roll rate of a vehicle can, and usually does, differ front to rear, which allows for the tuning ability of a vehicle for transient and steady state handling. The roll rate of a vehicle does not change the total amount of weight transfer on the vehicle, but shifts the speed at which and percentage of weight transferred on a particular axle to another axle through the vehicle chassis. Generally, the higher the roll rate on an axle of a vehicle, the faster and higher percentage the weight transfer on that axle.\n\nRoll couple percentage is a simplified method of describing lateral load transfer distribution front to rear, and subsequently handling balance. It is the effective wheel rate, in roll, of each axle of the vehicle as a ratio of the vehicle\u0027s total roll rate. It is commonly adjusted through the use of anti-roll bars, but can also be changed through the use of different springs.\n\nWheel rate\n\nRoll rate\n\nRoll couple percentage\n\nWeight transfer\n\nWeight transfer during cornering, acceleration or braking is usually calculated per individual wheel and compared with the static weights for the same wheels.\n\nThe total amount of weight transfer is only affected by four factors: the distance between wheel centers (wheelbase in the case of braking, or track width in the case of cornering) the height of the center of gravity, the mass of the vehicle, and the amount of acceleration experienced.\n\nThe speed at which weight transfer occurs as well as through which components it transfers is complex and is determined by many factors including but not limited to roll center height, spring and damper rates, anti-roll bar stiffness and the kinematic design of the suspension links. In most conventional applications, when weight is transferred through intentionally compliant elements such as springs, dampers and anti-roll bars, the weight transfer is said to be \"elastic\", while the weight which is transferred through more rigid suspension links such as A-arms and toe links is said to be \"geometric\".\n\nUnsprung weight transfer is calculated based on the weight of the vehicle\u0027s components that are not supported by the springs. This includes tires, wheels, brakes, spindles, half the control arm\u0027s weight and other components. These components are then (for calculation purposes) assumed to be connected to a vehicle with zero sprung weight. They are then put through the same dynamic loads. The weight transfer for cornering in the front would be equal to the total unsprung front weight times the G-Force times the front unsprung center of gravity height divided by the front track width. The same is true for the rear.\n\nSprung weight transfer is the weight transferred by only the weight of the vehicle resting on the springs, not the total vehicle weight. Calculating this requires knowing the vehicle\u0027s sprung weight (total weight less the unsprung weight), the front and rear roll center heights and the sprung center of gravity height (used to calculate the roll moment arm length). Calculating the front and rear sprung weight transfer will also require knowing the roll couple percentage.\n\nThe roll axis is the line through the front and rear roll centers that the vehicle rolls around during cornering. The distance from this axis to the sprung center of gravity height is the roll moment arm length. The total sprung weight transfer is equal to the G-force times the sprung weight times the roll moment arm length divided by the effective track width. The front sprung weight transfer is calculated by multiplying the roll couple percentage times the total sprung weight transfer. The rear is the total minus the front transfer.\n\nJacking forces are the sum of the vertical force components experienced by the suspension links. The resultant force acts to lift the sprung mass if the roll center is above ground, or compress it if underground. Generally, the higher the roll center, the more jacking force is experienced.\n\nTravel is the measure of distance from the bottom of the suspension stroke (such as when the vehicle is on a jack and the wheel hangs freely) to the top of the suspension stroke (such as when the vehicle\u0027s wheel can no longer travel in an upward direction toward the vehicle). Bottoming or lifting a wheel can cause serious control problems or directly cause damage. \"Bottoming\" can be caused by the suspension, tires, fenders, etc. running out of space to move or the body or other components of the car hitting the road. The control problems caused by lifting a wheel are less severe if the wheel lifts when the spring reaches its unloaded shape than they are if travel is limited by contact of suspension members (See Triumph TR3B.) Many off-road vehicles, such as desert racers, use straps\n\nUnsprung weight transfer\n\nSprung weight transfer\n\nJacking forces\n\nOther properties\n\nTravel\n\ncalled \"limiting straps\" to limit the suspensions downward travel to a point within safe limits for the linkages and shock absorbers. This is necessary, since these trucks are intended to travel over very rough terrain at high speeds, and even become airborne at times. Without something to limit the travel, the suspension bushings would take all the force when the suspension reaches \"full droop\", and it can even cause the coil springs to come out of their \"buckets\" if they are held in by compression forces only. A limiting strap is a simple strap, often nylon of a predetermined length, that stops the downward movement at a preset point before the theoretical maximum travel is reached. The opposite of this is the \"bump-stop\", which protects the suspension and vehicle (as well as the occupants) from violent \"bottoming\" of the suspension, caused when an obstruction (or hard landing) causes the suspension to run out of upward travel without fully absorbing the energy of the stroke. Without bump-stops, a vehicle that \"bottoms out\" will experience a very hard shock when the suspension contacts the bottom of the frame or body, which is transferred to the occupants and every connector and weld on the vehicle. Factory vehicles often come with plain rubber \"nubs\" to absorb the worst of the forces, and insulate the shock. A desert race vehicle, which must routinely absorb far higher impact forces, may be provided with pneumatic or hydro-pneumatic bump-stops. These are essentially miniature shock absorbers (dampeners) that are fixed to the vehicle in a location such that the suspension will contact the end of the piston when it nears the upward travel limit. These absorb the impact far more effectively than a solid rubber bump-stop will, essential because a rubber bump-stop is considered a \"last-ditch\" emergency insulator for the occasional accidental bottoming of the suspension; it is entirely insufficient to absorb repeated and heavy bottomings such as a high-speed off-road vehicle encounters.\n\nDamping is the control of motion or oscillation, as seen with the use of hydraulic gates and valves in a vehicle\u0027s shock absorber. This may also vary, intentionally or unintentionally. Like spring rate, the optimal damping for comfort may be less than for control.\n\nDamping controls the travel speed and resistance of the vehicle\u0027s suspension. An undamped car will oscillate up and down. With proper damping levels, the car will settle back to a normal state in a minimal amount of time. Most damping in modern vehicles can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the resistance to fluid flow in the shock absorber.\n\nSee dependent and independent below. Camber changes due to wheel travel, body roll and suspension system deflection or compliance. In general, a tire wears and brakes best at -1 to -2° of camber from vertical. Depending on the tire and the road surface, it may hold the road best at a slightly different angle. Small changes in camber, front and rear, can be used to tune handling. Some race cars are tuned with -2 to -7° camber depending on the type of handling desired and the tire construction. Often, too much camber will result in the decrease of braking performance due to a reduced contact patch size through excessive camber variation in the suspension geometry. The amount of camber change in bump is determined by the instantaneous front view swing arm (FVSA) length of the suspension geometry, or in other words, the tendency of the tire to camber inward when compressed in bump.\n\nRoll center height is a product of suspension instant center heights and is a useful metric in analyzing weight transfer effects, body roll and front to rear roll stiffness distribution. Conventionally, roll stiffness distribution is tuned adjusting antiroll bars rather than roll center height (as both tend to have a similar effect on the sprung mass), but the height of the roll center is significant when considering the amount of jacking forces experienced.\n\nDue to the fact that the wheel and tire\u0027s motion is constrained by the suspension links on the vehicle, the motion of the wheel package in the front view will scribe an imaginary arc in space with an \"instantaneous center\" of rotation at any given point along its path. The instant center for any wheel package can be found by following imaginary lines drawn through the suspension links to their intersection point.\n\nDamping\n\nCamber control\n\nRoll center height\n\nInstant center\n\nA component of the tire\u0027s force vector points from the contact patch of the tire through instant center. The larger this component is, the less suspension motion will occur. Theoretically, if the resultant of the vertical load on the tire and the lateral force generated by it points directly into the instant center, the suspension links will not move. In this case, all weight transfer at that end of the vehicle will be geometric in nature. This is key information used in finding the force-based roll center as well.\n\nIn this respect the instant centers are more important to the handling of the vehicle than the kinematic roll center alone, in that the ratio of geometric to elastic weight transfer is determined by the forces at the tires and their directions in relation to the position of their respective instant centers.\n\nAnti-dive and anti-squat are percentages that indicate the degree to which the front dives under braking and the rear squats under acceleration. They can be thought of as the counterparts for braking and acceleration, as jacking forces are to cornering. The main reason for the difference is due to the different design goals between front and rear suspension, whereas suspension is usually symmetrical between the left and right of the vehicle.\n\nThe method of determining the anti-dive or anti-squat depends on whether the suspension linkages react to the torque of braking and accelerating. For example, with inboard brakes and half-shaft driven rear wheels, the suspension linkages do not, but with outboard brakes and a swing-axle driveline, they do.\n\nTo determine the percentage of front suspension braking anti-dive for outboard brakes, it is first necessary to determine the tangent of the angle between a line drawn, in side view, through the front tire patch and the front suspension instant center, and the horizontal. In addition, the percentage of braking effort at the front wheels must be known. Then, multiply the tangent by the front wheel braking effort percentage and divide by the ratio of the center of gravity height to the wheelbase. A value of 50% would mean that half of the weight transfer to the front wheels, during braking, is being transmitted through the front suspension linkage and half is being transmitted through the front suspension springs.\n\nFor inboard brakes, the same procedure is followed but using the wheel center instead of contact patch center.\n\nForward acceleration anti-squat is calculated in a similar manner and with the same relationship between percentage and weight transfer. Anti-squat values of 100% and more are commonly used in drag racing, but values of 50% or less are more common in cars that have to undergo severe braking. Higher values of anti-squat commonly cause wheel hop during braking. It is important to note that, while the value of 100% means that all of the weight transfer is being carried through the suspension linkage. However, this does not mean that the suspension is incapable of carrying additional loads (aerodynamic, cornering, etc.) during an episode of braking or forward acceleration. In other words, no \"binding\" of the suspension is to be implied.[8]\n\nIn some modern cars, the flexibility is mainly in the rubber bushings, which are subject to decay over time. For high-stress suspensions, such as off-road vehicles, polyurethane bushings are available, which offer more longevity under greater stresses. However, due to weight and cost considerations, structures are not made more rigid than necessary. Some vehicles exhibit detrimental vibrations involving the flexing of structural parts, such as when accelerating while turning sharply. Flexibility of structures such as frames and suspension links can also contribute to springing, especially to damping out high frequency vibrations. The flexibility of wire wheels contributed to their popularity in times when cars had less advanced suspensions.\n\nVariations in suspension design\n\nAnti-dive and anti-squat\n\nFlexibility and vibration modes of the suspension elements\n\nLoad levelling\n\nAutomobiles can be heavily laden with luggage, passengers, and trailers. This loading will cause a vehicle\u0027s tail to sink downwards. Maintaining a steady chassis level is essential to achieving the proper handling the vehicle was designed for. Oncoming drivers can be blinded by the headlight beam. Self-levelling suspension counteracts this by inflating cylinders in the suspension to lift the chassis higher.[9]\n\nFor most purposes, the weight of the suspension components is unimportant, but at high frequencies, caused by road surface roughness, the parts isolated by rubber bushings act as a multistage filter to suppress noise and vibration better than can be done with only the tires and springs. (The springs work mainly in the vertical direction.)\n\nThese are usually small, except that the suspension is related to whether the brakes and differential(s) are sprung.\n\nThis is the main functional advantage of aluminum wheels over steel wheels. Aluminum suspension parts have been used in production cars, and carbon fiber suspension parts are common in racing cars.\n\nDesigns differ as to how much space they take up and where it is located. It is generally accepted that MacPherson struts are the most compact arrangement for front-engined vehicles, where space between the wheels is required to place the engine.\n\nInboard brakes (which reduce unsprung weight) are probably avoided more due to space considerations than to cost.\n\nThe suspension attachment must match the frame design in geometry, strength and rigidity.\n\nCertain modern vehicles have height adjustable suspension in order to improve aerodynamics and fuel efficiency. Modern formula cars that have exposed wheels and suspension typically use streamlined tubing rather than simple round tubing for their suspension arms to reduce aerodynamic drag. Also typical is the use of rocker arm, push rod, or pull rod type suspensions that, among other things, place the spring/damper unit inboard and out of the air stream to further reduce air resistance.\n\nProduction methods improve, but cost is always a factor. The continued use of the solid rear axle, with unsprung differential, especially on heavy vehicles, seems to be the most obvious example.\n\nMost conventional suspensions use passive springs to absorb impacts and dampers (or shock absorbers) to control spring motions.\n\nSome notable exceptions are the hydropneumatic systems, which can be treated as an integrated unit of gas spring and damping components, used by the French manufacturer Citroën and the hydrolastic, hydragas and rubber cone systems used by the British Motor Corporation, most notably on the Mini. A number of different types of each have been used:\n\nIsolation from high frequency shock\n\nContribution to unsprung weight and total weight\n\nSpace occupied\n\nForce distribution\n\nAir resistance (drag)\n\nCost\n\nSprings and dampers\n\nPassive suspensions\n\nTraditional springs and dampers are referred to as passive suspensions - most vehicles are suspended in this manner.\n\nThe majority of land vehicles are suspended by steel springs, of these types:\n\nLeaf spring - AKA Hotchkiss, Cart, or semi-elliptical spring[4] Torsion beam suspension[10]\n\nCoil spring[11]\n\nAutomakers are aware of the inherent limitations of steel springs, that they tend to produce undesirable oscillations, and have developed other types of suspension materials and mechanisms in attempts to improve performance:\n\nRubber bushing[12]\n\nGas under pressure - air spring[13]\n\nGas and hydraulic fluid under pressure - hydropneumatic suspension[14] and oleo strut\n\nThe shock absorbers damp out the (otherwise simple harmonic) motions of a vehicle up and down on its springs. They also must damp out much of the wheel bounce when the unsprung weight of a wheel, hub, axle and sometimes brakes and differential bounces up and down on the springiness of a tire. Some have suggested that the regular bumps found on dirt roads (nicknamed \"corduroy\", but properly corrugations or washboarding) are caused by this wheel bounce, though some evidence exists that it is unrelated to suspension at all. (See washboarding.)\n\nIf the suspension is externally controlled then it is a semi-active or active suspension - the suspension is reacting to signals from an electronic controller.\n\nFor example, a hydropneumatic Citroën will \"know\" how far off the ground the car is supposed to be and constantly reset to achieve that level, regardless of load. It will not instantly compensate for body roll due to cornering however. Citroën\u0027s system adds about 1% to the cost of the car versus passive steel springs.\n\nSemi-active suspensions include devices such as air springs and switchable shock absorbers, various self-levelling solutions, as well as systems like hydropneumatic, hydrolastic, and hydragas suspensions. Mitsubishi developed the world\u0027s first production semi-active electronically controlled suspension system in passenger cars; the system was first incorporated in the 1987 Galant model.[15][16][17][18][19] Delphi currently sells shock absorbers filled with a magneto-rheological fluid, whose viscosity can be changed electromagnetically, thereby giving variable control without switching valves, which is faster and thus more effective.\n\nFully active suspension systems use electronic monitoring of vehicle conditions, coupled with the means to impact vehicle suspension and behavior in real time to directly control the motion of the car. Lotus Cars developed several prototypes, from 1982 onwards, and introduced them to F1, where they have been fairly effective, but have now been banned. Nissan introduced a low bandwidth active suspension in circa 1990 as an option that added an extra 20% to the price of luxury models. Citroën has also developed several active suspension models (see hydractive). A recently publicised fully active system from Bose Corporation uses linear electric motors (i.e., solenoids) in place of hydraulic or pneumatic actuators that have generally been used up until recently. Mercedes introduced an active suspension system called Active Body Control in its top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benz CL-Class in 1999.\n\nSeveral electromagnetic suspensions have also been developed for vehicles. Examples include the electromagnetic suspension of Bose, and the electromagnetic suspension developed by prof. Laurentiu Encica. In addition, the new Michelin wheel with embedded suspension working on an electromotor is also similar.[20]\n\nSprings\n\nPneumatic spring on a semitrailer\n\nDampers or shock absorbers\n\nSemi-active and active suspensions\n\nWith the help of control system, various semi-active/active suspensions realize an improved design compromise among different vibrations modes of the vehicle, namely bounce, roll, pitch and warp modes. However, the applications of these advanced suspensions are constrained by the cost, packaging, weight, reliability, and/or the other challenges.\n\nInterconnected suspension, unlike semi-active/active suspensions, could easily decouple different vehicle vibration modes in a passive manner. The interconnections can be realized by various means, such as mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic. Anti-roll bars are one of the typical examples of mechanical interconnections, while it has been stated that fluidic interconnections offer greater potential and flexibility in improving both the stiffness and damping properties.\n\nConsidering the considerable commercial potentials of hydro-pneumatic technology (Corolla, 1996), interconnected hydropneumatic suspensions have also been explored in some recent studies, and their potential benefits in enhancing vehicle ride and handling have been demonstrated. The control system can also be used for further improving performance of interconnected suspensions. Apart from academic research, an Australian company, Kinetic,[21] had some success (WRC: 3 Championships, Dakar Rally: 2 Championships, Lexus GX470 2004 4×4 of the year with KDSS, 2005 PACE award) with various passive or semi-active systems, which generally decouple at least two vehicle modes (roll, warp (articulation), pitch and/or heave (bounce)) to simultaneously control each mode\u0027s stiffness and damping, by using interconnected shock absorbers, and other methods. In 1999, Kinetic was bought out by Tenneco. Later developments by a Catalan company, Creuat has devised a simpler system design based on single-acting cylinders. After some projects on competition Creuat is active in providing retrofit systems for some vehicle models.\n\nHistorically, the first mass production car with front to rear mechanical interconnected suspension was the 1948 Citroën 2CV. The suspension of the 2CV was extremely soft-the longitudinal link was making pitch softer instead of making roll stiffer. It relied on extreme antidive and antisquat geometries to compensate for that. This redunded into a softer axle crossing stiffness that anti-roll bars would have otherwise compromised. The leading arm / trailing arm swinging arm, fore-aft linked suspension system together with inboard front brakes had a much smaller unsprung weight than existing coil spring or leaf designs. The interconnection transmitted some of the force deflecting a front wheel up over a bump, to push the rear wheel down on the same side. When the rear wheel met that bump a moment later, it did the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. The 2CV had a design brief to be able to be driven at speed over a ploughed field. It originally featured friction dampers and tuned mass dampers. Later models had tuned mass dampers at the front with telescopic dampers/shock absorbers front and rear.\n\nThe British Motor Corporation was also an early adopter of interconnected suspension. A system dubbed Hydrolastic was introduced in 1962 on the Morris 1100 and went on to be used on a variety of BMC models. Hydrolastic was developed by suspension engineer Alex Moulton and used rubber cones as the springing medium (these were first used on the 1959 Mini) with the suspension units on each side connected to each other by a fluid filled pipe. The fluid transmitted the force of road bumps from one wheel to the other (on the same principle as the Citroen 2CV\u0027s mechanical system described above) and because each suspension unit contained valves to restrict the flow of fluid also served as a shock absorber.[22] Moulton went on to develop a replacement for Hydrolastic for BMC\u0027s successor, British Leyland. This system manufactured under licence by Dunlop in Coventry, called Hydragas worked on the same principle but instead of rubber spring units it used metal spheres divided internally by a rubber diaphragm. The top half contained pressurised gas and the lower half the same fluid as used on the Hydrolastic system. The fluid transmitted suspension forces between the units on each side whilst the gas acted as the springing medium via the diaphragm. This is the same principle as the Citroen hydropneumatic system and provides a similar ride quality but is self-contained and doesn\u0027t require an engine-driven pump to provide hydraulic pressure. The downside is that Hydragas is, unlike the Citroen system, not height adjustable or self-levelling. Hydragas was introduced in 1973 on the Austin Allegro and was used on several models, the last car to use it being the MG F in 2002. The system was changed in favour of coil springs over dampers, due to cost reasons, towards the end of the vehicle\u0027s life. When it was decommissioned in 2006 the Hydragas manufacturing line was over 40 years old.\n\nSome of the last post-war Packard models also featured interconnected suspension.\n\nInterconnected suspensions\n\nSuspension geometry\n\nSuspension systems can be broadly classified into two subgroups: dependent and independent. These terms refer to the ability of opposite wheels to move independently of each other.\n\nA dependent suspension normally has a beam (a simple \u0027cart\u0027 axle) or (driven) live axle that holds wheels parallel to each other and perpendicular to the axle. When the camber of one wheel changes, the camber of the opposite wheel changes in the same way (by convention on one side this is a positive change in camber and on the other side this a negative change). De Dion suspensions are also in this category as they rigidly connect the wheels together.\n\nAn independent suspension allows wheels to rise and fall on their own without affecting the opposite wheel. Suspensions with other devices, such as sway bars that link the wheels in some way are still classed as independent.\n\nA third type is a semi-dependent suspension. In this case, the motion of one wheel does affect the position of the other but they are not rigidly attached to each other. A twist-beam rear suspension is such a system.\n\nDependent systems may be differentiated by the system of linkages used to locate them, both longitudinally and transversely. Often both functions are combined in a set of linkages.\n\nExamples of location linkages include:\n\nSatchell link Panhard rod Watt\u0027s linkage WOBLink Mumford linkage\n\nLeaf springs used for location (transverse or longitudinal)\n\nFully elliptical springs usually need supplementary location links and are no longer in common use\n\nLongitudinal semi-elliptical springs used to be common and still are used in heavy-duty trucks and aircraft. They have the advantage that the spring rate can easily be made progressive (non-linear).\n\nA single transverse leaf spring for both front wheels and/or both back wheels, supporting solid axles, was used by Ford Motor Company, before and soon after World War II, even on expensive models. It had the advantages of simplicity and low unsprung weight (compared to other solid axle designs).\n\nIn a front engine, rear-drive vehicle, dependent rear suspension is either \"live axle\" or deDion axle, depending on whether or not the differential is carried on the axle. Live axle is simpler but the unsprung weight contributes to wheel bounce.\n\nBecause it assures constant camber, dependent (and semi-independent) suspension is most common on vehicles that need to carry large loads as a proportion of the vehicle weight, that have relatively soft springs and that do not (for cost and simplicity reasons) use active suspensions. The use of dependent front suspension has become limited to heavier commercial vehicles.\n\nCommon types seen from behind; in order: Live axle with Watt bar Suspension like on a bike fork Swing axle Double wishbone suspension MacPherson This diagram is not exhaustive; notably excluding elements such as trailing arm links and those that are flexible.\n\nDependent suspensions\n\nIndependent suspensions\n\nThe variety of independent systems is greater and includes:\n\nSwing axle Sliding pillar MacPherson strut/Chapman strut\n\nUpper and lower A-arm (double wishbone)\n\nMulti-link suspension\n\nSemi-trailing arm suspension\n\nSwinging arm\n\nLeaf springs\n\nTransverse leaf springs when used as a suspension link, or four quarter elliptics on one end of a car are similar to wishbones in geometry, but are more compliant. Examples are the front of the original Fiat 500, the Panhard Dyna Z and the early examples of Peugeot 403 and the back of the AC Ace and AC Aceca.\n\nBecause the wheels are not constrained to remain perpendicular to a flat road surface in turning, braking and varying load conditions, control of the wheel camber is an important issue. Swinging arm was common in small cars that were sprung softly and could carry large loads, because the camber is independent of load. Some active and semi-active suspensions maintain the ride height, and therefore the camber, independent of load. In sports cars, optimal camber change when turning is more important.\n\nWishbone and multi-link allow the engineer more control over the geometry, to arrive at the best compromise, than swing axle, MacPherson strut or swinging arm do; however the cost and space requirements may be greater. Semi-trailing arm is in between, being a variable compromise between the geometries of swinging arm and swing axle.\n\nIn a semi-independent suspensions, the wheels of an axle are able to move relative to one another as in an independent suspension but the position of one wheel has an effect on the position and attitude of the other wheel. This effect is achieved via the twisting or deflecting of suspension parts under load. The most common type of semi-independent suspension is the twist beam.\n\nTwist beam\n\nTilting Suspension System[23] (Also known as Leaning Suspension System) is not actually a different type or different geometry of construction, moreover it is a technology addition to the conventional suspension system.\n\nThis kind of suspension system mainly consist of independent suspension (e.g., MacPherson strut, A-arm (double wishbone)). With addition with these suspension system there is a further tilting or leaning mechanism which connects the suspension system with the vehicle body (chassis).\n\nThis kind of suspension system improves stability, traction, turning radius of vehicle and comfort of riders as well. While turning right or left passengers or objects on a vehicle feel G-force or inertial force outward the radius of curvature that is why Two Wheeler riders lean towards the center of curvature while turning which improves stability and decrease the chances of toppling. But for vehicle more than two wheels and with conventional suspension system could not do the same till now so the passengers feel the outward inertial force which reduce the stability of passengers and comfort as well. This kind of tilting suspension system is the solution of the problem. If the road do not have super-elevation or banking it will not affect the comfort with this suspension system, the vehicle tilt and decrease the height of center of gravity with increase the stability. This is also used in fun vehicle.\n\nSome trains also use tilting suspension (Tilting Train) with increase the speed at cornering.\n\nA rear independent suspension on an AWD car.\n\nSemi-independent suspension\n\nTilting Suspension System\n\nRocker bogie mechanism\n\nThe rocker-bogie system is the suspension arrangement in which there are some trailing arm fitted with some idler wheels, due to the articulation between the driving section and the followers this suspension is very flexible. this kind of suspension is appropriate for extremely rough terrain.\n\nThis kind of suspension was used in the Curiosity rover.\n\nSome vehicles such as trains run on long rail tracks fixed to the ground, and some such as tractors, snow vehicles and tanks run on continuous tracks that are part of the vehicle. Though either sort helps to smooth the path and reduce ground pressure, many of the same considerations apply.\n\nMilitary AFVs, including tanks, have specialized suspension requirements. They can weigh more than seventy tons and are required to move as quickly as possible over very rough or soft ground. Their suspension components must be protected from land mines and antitank weapons. Tracked AFVs can have as many as nine road wheels on each side. Many wheeled AFVs have six or eight large wheels. Some have a Central Tire Inflation System to reduce ground loading on poor surfaces. Some wheels are too big and confined to turn, so skid steering is used with some wheeled, as well as with tracked, vehicles.\n\nThe earliest tanks of World War I had fixed suspension with no designed movement whatsoever. This unsatisfactory situation was improved with leaf spring or coil spring suspensions adopted from agricultural, automotive or railway machinery, but even these had very limited travel.\n\nSpeeds increased due to more powerful engines, and the quality of ride had to be improved. In the 1930s, the Christie suspension was developed, which allowed the use of coil springs inside a vehicle\u0027s armored hull, by changing the direction of force deforming the spring, using a bell crank. The T-34\u0027s suspension was directly descended from Christie designs. Horstmann suspension was a variation which used a combination of bell crank and exterior coil springs, in use from the 1930s to the 1990s. The bogie, but nonetheless independent, suspension of the M3 Lee/Grant and the M4 Sherman was similar to the Hortsmann type, with the suspension contained within the track oval.\n\nBy World War II the other common type was torsion bar suspension, getting spring force from twisting bars inside the hull - this sometimes had less travel than the Christie-type, but was significantly more compact, allowing more space inside the hull, with consequent possibility to install larger turret rings and thus a heavier main armament. The torsion-bar suspension, sometimes including shock absorbers, has been the dominant heavy armored vehicle suspension since World War II. Torsion bars may take space under or near the floor, which may interfere with making the tank low to reduce exposure.\n\nAs with cars, wheel travel and spring rate affect the bumpiness of the ride and the speed at which rough terrain can be negotiated. It may be significant that a smooth ride, which is often associated with comfort, increases the accuracy when firing on the move (analogously to battle ships with reduced stability, due to reduced metacentric height). It also reduces shock on optics and other equipment. The unsprung weight and track link weight may limit speed on roads and affect the life of the track and other components.\n\nMost German WW II half tracks and their tanks introduced during the war such as the Panther tank had overlapping and sometimes interleaved road wheels to distribute the load more evenly on the track and therefore on the ground. This apparently made a significant contribution to speed, range and track life, as well as providing a continuous band of protection. It has not been used since the end of that war, probably due to the maintenance requirements of more complicated mechanical parts working in mud, sand,\n\nTracked vehicles\n\nArmoured fighting vehicle suspension\n\nThis Grant I tank\u0027s suspension has road wheels mounted on wheel trucks, or bogies.\n\nrocks, snow and ice, as well as to cost. Rocks and frozen mud often got stuck between the overlapping wheels, which could prevent them from turning or cause damage to the road wheels. If one of the interior road wheels were damaged, it would require other road wheels to be removed in order to access the damaged road wheel, making the process more complicated and time-consuming.[24]\n\n4-poster - a test rig\n\n7 post shaker - a test rig for high speed vehicles Automotive suspension design - the design process Caster angle - self centering steering Coilover\n\nCorvette leaf spring - independent suspension combined with a transverse fiber reinforced plastic leaf spring Korres P4 - a Greek all-terrain supercar, with a unique suspension\n\nMagnetic levitation Maglev train Scrub radius\n\nShort long arms suspension - also known as \"unequal length A arm\", one of the design parameters of double wishbone suspension\n\nStrut bar - a form of semi-independent suspension\n\nOleo strut - design used in most large aircraft, with compressed gas and hydraulic fluid - conceptually similar to automobile Hydropneumatic suspension\n\n1.

Vehicles which carry heavy loads will often have heavier springs to compensate for the additional weight that would otherwise collapse a vehicle to the bottom of its travel (stroke). Heavier springs are also used in performance applications where the loading conditions experienced are more extreme.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSprings that are too hard or too soft cause the suspension to become ineffective because they fail to properly isolate the vehicle from the road. Vehicles that commonly experience suspension loads heavier than normal have heavy or hard springs with a spring rate close to the upper limit for that vehicle\u0027s weight. This allows the vehicle to perform properly under a heavy load when control is limited by the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia\"\u003einerti\u003c/a\u003ea of the load. Riding in an empty truck used for carrying loads can be uncomfortable for passengers because of its high spring rate relative to the weight of the vehicle. A race car would also be described as having heavy springs and would also be uncomfortably bumpy. However, even though we say they both have heavy springs, the actual spring rates for a 2,000 lb (910 kg) race car and a 10,000 lb (4,500 kg) truck are very different. A luxury car, taxi, or passenger bus would be described as having soft springs. Vehicles with worn out or damaged springs ride lower to the ground which reduces the overall amount of compression available to the suspension and increases the amount of body lean.

This is as opposed to simply measuring the spring rate alone.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWheel rate is usually equal to or considerably less than the spring rate. Commonly, springs are mounted on control arms, swing arms or some other pivoting suspension member. Consider the example above where the spring rate was calculated to be 500 lbs/inch (87.5 N/mm), if you were to move the wheel 1 in (2.5 cm) (without moving the car), the spring more than likely compresses a smaller amount. Let\u0027s assume the spring moved 0.75 in (19 mm), the lever arm ratio would be 0.75:1. The wheel rate is calculated by taking the square of the ratio (0.5625) times the spring rate, thus obtaining 281.25 lbs/inch (49.25 N/mm). Squaring the ratio is because the ratio has two effects on the wheel rate. The ratio applies to both the force and distance traveled.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWheel rate on independent suspension is fairly straightforward. However, special consideration must be taken with some non-independent suspension designs. Take the case of the straight axle. When viewed from the front or rear, the wheel rate can be measured by the means above. Yet because the wheels are not independent, when viewed from the side under acceleration or braking the pivot point is at infinity (because both wheels have moved) and the spring is directly inline with the wheel contact patch. The result is often that the effective wheel rate under cornering is different from what it is under acceleration and braking. This variation in wheel rate may be minimized by locating the spring as close to the wheel as possible.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWheel rates are usually summed and compared with the sprung mass of a vehicle to create a \"ride rate\" and corresponding suspension\n\u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance\"\u003enatural frequency\u003c/a\u003e in ride (also referred to as \"heave\").

It is expressed as torque per degree of roll of the vehicle sprung mass. It is influenced by factors including but not limited to vehicle sprung mass, track width, CG height, spring and damper rates, roll center heights of front and rear, anti-roll bar stiffness and tire pressure/construction. The roll rate of a vehicle can, and usually does, differ front to rear, which allows for the tuning ability of a vehicle for transient and steady state handling. The roll rate of a vehicle does not change the total amount of weight transfer on the vehicle, but shifts the speed at which and percentage of weight transferred on a particular axle to another axle through the vehicle chassis. Generally, the higher the roll rate on an axle of a vehicle, the faster and higher percentage the weight transfer on that axle.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cp\u003eRoll couple percentage is a simplified method of describing lateral load transfer distribution front to rear, and subsequently handling balance.

In most conventional applications, when weight is transferred through intentionally compliant elements such as springs, dampers and anti-roll bars, the weight transfer is said to be \"elastic\", while the weight which is transferred through more rigid suspension links such as A-arms and toe links is said to be \"geometric\".\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnsprung weight transfer is calculated based on the weight of the vehicle\u0027s components that are not supported by the springs. This includes tires, wheels, brakes, spindles, half the control arm\u0027s weight and other components. These components are then (for calculation purposes) assumed to be connected to a vehicle with zero sprung weight. They are then put through the same dynamic loads. The weight transfer for cornering in the front would be equal to the total unsprung front weight times the G-Force times the front unsprung center of gravity height divided by the front track width. The same is true for the rear.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSprung weight transfer is the weight transferred by only the weight of the vehicle resting on the springs, not the total vehicle weight.

Bottoming or lifting a wheel can cause serious control problems or directly cause damage. \"Bottoming\" can be caused by the suspension, tires, fenders, etc. running out of space to move or the body or other components of the car hitting the road. The control problems caused by lifting a wheel are less severe if the wheel lifts when the spring reaches its unloaded shape than they are if travel is limited by contact of suspension members (See \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_TR3B\"\u003eTriumph TR3\u003c/a\u003eB.)

This is necessary, since these trucks are intended to travel over very rough terrain at high speeds, and even become airborne at times. Without something to limit the travel, the suspension bushings would take all the force when the suspension reaches \"full droop\", and it can even cause the coil springs to come out of their \"buckets\" if they are held in by compression forces only. A limiting strap is a simple strap, often nylon of a predetermined length, that stops the downward movement at a preset point before the theoretical maximum travel is reached. The opposite of this is the \"bump-stop\", which protects the suspension and vehicle (as well as the occupants) from violent \"bottoming\" of the suspension, caused when an obstruction (or hard landing) causes the suspension to run out of upward travel without fully absorbing the energy of the stroke. Without bump-stops, a vehicle that \"bottoms out\" will experience a very hard shock when the suspension contacts the bottom of the frame or body, which is transferred to the occupants and every connector and weld on the vehicle. Factory vehicles often come with plain rubber \"nubs\" to absorb the worst of the forces, and insulate the shock. A desert race vehicle, which must routinely absorb far higher impact forces, may be provided with pneumatic or hydro-pneumatic bump-stops. These are essentially miniature shock absorbers (dampeners) that are fixed to the vehicle in a location such that the suspension will contact the end of the piston when it nears the upward travel limit. These absorb the impact far more effectively than a solid rubber bump-stop will, essential because a rubber bump-stop is considered a \"last-ditch\" emergency insulator for the occasional accidental bottoming of the suspension; it is entirely insufficient to absorb repeated and heavy bottomings such as a high-speed off-road vehicle encounters.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping\"\u003eDamping\u003c/a\u003e is the control of motion or oscillation, as seen with the use of hydraulic gates and valves in a vehicle\u0027s shock absorber.

An undamped car will oscillate up and down. With proper damping levels, the car will settle back to a normal state in a minimal amount of time. Most damping in modern vehicles can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the resistance to fluid flow in the shock absorber.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee dependent and independent below. \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camber_angle\"\u003eCamber\u003c/a\u003e changes due to wheel travel, body roll and suspension system deflection or compliance. In general, a tire wears and brakes best at -1 to -2° of camber from vertical. Depending on the tire and the road surface, it may hold the road best at a slightly different angle. Small changes in camber, front and rear, can be used to tune handling. Some race cars are tuned with -2 to -7° camber depending on the type of handling desired and the tire construction. Often, too much camber will result in the decrease of braking performance due to a reduced contact patch size through excessive camber variation in the suspension geometry. The amount of camber change in bump is determined by the instantaneous front view swing arm (FVSA) length of the suspension geometry, or in other words, the tendency of the tire to camber inward when compressed in bump.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRoll center height is a product of suspension instant center heights and is a useful metric in analyzing weight transfer effects, body roll and front to rear roll stiffness distribution.

The larger this component is, the less suspension motion will occur. Theoretically, if the resultant of the vertical load on the tire and the lateral force generated by it points directly into the instant center, the suspension links will not move. In this case, all weight transfer at that end of the vehicle will be geometric in nature. This is key information used in finding the force-based roll center as well.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this respect the instant centers are more important to the handling of the vehicle than the kinematic roll center alone, in that the ratio of geometric to elastic weight transfer is determined by the forces at the tires and their directions in relation to the position of their respective instant centers.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnti-dive and anti-squat are percentages that indicate the degree to which the front dives under braking and the rear squats under acceleration. They can be thought of as the counterparts for braking and acceleration, as jacking forces are to cornering. The main reason for the difference is due to the different design goals between front and rear suspension, whereas suspension is usually symmetrical between the left and right of the vehicle.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe method of determining the anti-dive or anti-squat depends on whether the suspension linkages react to the torque of braking and accelerating. For example, with inboard brakes and half-shaft driven rear wheels, the suspension linkages do not, but with outboard brakes and a swing-axle driveline, they do.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo determine the percentage of front suspension braking anti-dive for outboard brakes, it is first necessary to determine the tangent of the angle between a line drawn, in side view, through the front tire patch and the front suspension instant center, and the horizontal. In addition, the percentage of braking effort at the front wheels must be known. Then, multiply the tangent by the front wheel braking effort percentage and divide by the ratio of the center of gravity height to the wheelbase. A value of 50% would mean that half of the weight transfer to the front wheels, during braking, is being transmitted through the front suspension linkage and half is being transmitted through the front suspension springs.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor inboard brakes, the same procedure is followed but using the wheel center instead of contact patch center.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eForward acceleration anti-squat is calculated in a similar manner and with the same relationship between percentage and weight transfer. Anti-squat values of 100% and more are commonly used in drag racing, but values of 50% or less are more common in cars that have to undergo severe braking. Higher values of anti-squat commonly cause wheel hop during braking. It is important to note that, while the value of 100% means that all of the weight transfer is being carried through the suspension linkage. However, this does not mean that the suspension is incapable of carrying additional loads (aerodynamic, cornering, etc.) during an episode of braking or forward acceleration. In other words, no \"binding\" of the suspension is to be implied.[8]\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn some modern cars, the flexibility is mainly in the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_bushing\"\u003erubber bushings\u003c/a\u003e, which are subject to decay over time. For high-stress suspensions, such as off-road vehicles, polyurethane bushings are available, which offer more longevity under greater stresses. However, due to weight and cost considerations, structures are not made more rigid than necessary. Some vehicles exhibit detrimental vibrations involving the flexing of structural parts, such as when accelerating while turning sharply. Flexibility of structures such as frames and suspension links can also contribute to springing, especially to damping out high frequency vibrations. The flexibility of wire wheels contributed to their popularity in times when cars had less advanced suspensions.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cp\u003eVariations in suspension design\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnti-dive and anti-squat\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFlexibility and vibration modes of the suspension elements\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLoad levelling\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAutomobiles can be heavily laden with luggage, passengers, and trailers.

For information on two-wheeled vehicles\u0027 suspensions see the motorcycle suspension, motorcycle fork, bicycle suspension, and bicycle fork articles.\n\nSuspension is the system of tires, tire air, springs, shock absorbers and linkages that connects a vehicle to its wheels and allows relative motion between the two.[1] Suspension systems must support both roadholding/handling and ride quality,[2] which are at odds with each other. The tuning of suspensions involves finding the right compromise. It is important for the suspension to keep the road wheel in contact with the road surface as much as possible, because all the road or ground forces acting on the vehicle do so through the contact patches of the tires. The suspension also protects the vehicle itself and any cargo or luggage from damage and wear. The design of front and rear suspension of a car may be different.\n\n1 History\n\n2 Difference between rear suspension and front suspension\n\n2.1 History\n\n3 Spring, wheel, and roll rates\n\n3.1 Spring rate\n\n3.1.1 Mathematics of the spring rate 3.2 Wheel rate 3.3 Roll rate\n\n3.4 Roll couple percentage\n\n4 Weight transfer\n\n4.1 Unsprung weight transfer 4.2 Sprung weight transfer 4.3 Jacking forces\n\n5 Other properties\n\n5.1 Travel 5.2 Damping 5.3 Camber control\n\n5.4 Roll center height\n\n5.5 Instant center\n\n6 Variations in suspension design\n\n6.1 Anti-dive and anti-squat 6.2\n\nFlexibility and vibration modes of the suspension elements 6.3 Load levelling\n\n6.4 Isolation from high frequency shock\n\n6.5 Contribution to unsprung weight and total weight 6.6 Space occupied 6.7 Force distribution 6.8 Air resistance (drag)\n\n6.9 Cost\n\nThe front suspension components of a Ford Model T.\n\nThe rear suspension on a truck: a leaf spring.\n\nContents\n\n7 Springs and dampers\n\n7.1 Passive suspensions 7.1.1 Springs\n\n7.1.2 Dampers or shock absorbers 7.2 Semi-active and active suspensions 7.3 Interconnected suspensions\n\n8 Suspension geometry\n\n8.1 Dependent suspensions 8.2 Independent suspensions 8.3 Semi-independent suspension\n\n9 Tilting Suspension System 10 Rocker bogie mechanism 11 Tracked vehicles\n\n12 Armoured fighting vehicle suspension\n\n13 See also\n\n14 References\n\n15 External links\n\nAn early form of suspension on ox-drawn carts had the platform swing on iron chains attached to the wheeled frame of the carriage. This system remained the basis for all suspension systems until the turn of the 19th century, although the iron chains were replaced with the use of leather straps by the 17th century. No modern automobiles use the \u0027strap suspension\u0027 system.\n\nAutomobiles were initially developed as self-propelled versions of horse-drawn vehicles. However, horse-drawn vehicles had been designed for relatively slow speeds, and their suspension was not well suited to the higher speeds permitted by the internal combustion engine.\n\nThe first workable spring-suspension required advanced metallurgical knowledge and skill, and only became possible with the advent of industrialisation. Obadiah Elliott registered the first patent for a spring-suspension vehicle; - each wheel had two durable steel leaf springs on each side and the body of the carriage was fixed directly to the springs which were attached to the axles. Within a decade, most British horse carriages were equipped with springs; wooden springs in the case of light one-horse vehicles to avoid taxation, and steel springs in larger vehicles. These were often made of low-carbon steel and usually took the form of multiple layer leaf springs.[3]\n\nLeaf springs have been around since the early Egyptians. Ancient military engineers used leaf springs in the form of bows to power their siege engines, with little success at first. The use of leaf springs in catapults was later refined and made to work years later. Springs were not only made of metal, a sturdy tree branch could be used as a spring, such as with a bow. Horse-drawn carriages and the Ford Model T used this system, and it is still used today in larger vehicles, mainly mounted in the rear suspension.[4]\n\nPart of car front suspension and steering mechanism: tie rod, steering arm, king pin axis (using ball joints).\n\nVan Diemen RF01 Racing Car Suspension.\n\nHistory\n\nStrap suspension 1605\n\nStrap suspension 2008 note the transverse limiting straps\n\nThis was the first modern suspension system and, along with advances in the construction of roads, heralded the single greatest improvement in road transport until the advent of the automobile.[5] The British steel springs were not well suited for use on America\u0027s rough roads of the time, so the Abbot-Downing Company of Concord, New Hampshire re-introduced leather strap suspension, which gave a swinging motion instead of the jolting up and down of a spring suspension.\n\nIn 1901 Mors of Paris first fitted an automobile with shock absorbers. With the advantage of a damped suspension system on his \u0027Mors Machine\u0027, Henri Fournier won the prestigious Paris-to-Berlin race on 20 June 1901. Fournier\u0027s superior time was 11 hrs 46 min 10 sec, while the best competitor was Léonce Girardot in a Panhard with a time of 12 hrs 15 min 40 sec.[6]\n\nCoil springs first appeared on a production vehicle in 1906 in the Brush Runabout made by the Brush Motor Company. Today, coil springs are used in most cars.\n\nIn 1920, Leyland Motors used torsion bars in a suspension system.\n\nIn 1922, independent front suspension was pioneered on the Lancia Lambda and became more common in mass market cars from 1932.[7] Today most cars have independent suspension on all four wheels.\n\nIn 2002, a new passive suspension component was invented by Malcolm C. Smith, the inerter. This has the ability to increase the effective inertia of a wheel suspension using a geared flywheel, but without adding significant mass. It was initially employed in Formula 1 in secrecy but has since spread to other motorsport.\n\nObviously any four wheel vehicle needs suspension for both the front wheels and the rear suspension, but in two wheel drive vehicles these can be very different configuration. For front-wheel drive cars, rear suspension has few constraints and a variety of beam axles and independent suspensions are used. For rear-wheel drive cars, rear suspension has many constraints and the development of the superior but more expensive independent suspension layout has been difficult. Four-wheel drive often have suspensions that are similar for both the front and rear wheels.\n\nHenry Ford\u0027s Model T used a torque tube to restrain this force, for his differential was attached to the chassis by a lateral leaf spring and two narrow rods. The torque tube surrounded the true driveshaft and exerted the force to its ball joint at the extreme rear of the transmission, which was attached to the engine. A similar method was used by the late-1930s Buick and by Hudson\u0027s bathtub car of 1948, which used helical springs which could not take fore-and-aft thrust.\n\nThe Hotchkiss drive, invented by Albert Hotchkiss, was the most popular rear suspension system used in American cars from the 1930s to the 1970s. The system uses longitudinal leaf springs attached both forward and behind the differential of the live axle. These springs transmit the torque to the frame. Although scorned by many European car makers of the time, it was accepted by American car makers because it was inexpensive to manufacture. Also, the dynamic defects of this design were suppressed by the enormous weight of US passenger vehicles before implementation of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard.\n\nAnother Frenchman invented the De Dion tube, which is sometimes called \"semi-independent\". Like a true independent rear suspension, this employs two universal joints or their equivalent from the center of the differential to each wheel. But the wheels cannot entirely rise and fall independently of each other; they are tied by a yoke that goes around the differential, below and behind it. This method has had little use in the United States, though it does not evidence the bump steer that a more expensive, true independent suspension does. Its use around 1900 was probably due to the poor quality of tires, which wore out quickly. By removing a good deal of unsprung weight, as independent rear suspensions do, it made them last longer.\n\nHenri Fournier on his uniquely damped and racewinning \u0027Mors Machine\u0027, photo taken 1902\n\nDifference between rear suspension and front suspension\n\nHistory\n\nRear wheel drive vehicles today frequently use a fairly complex fully independent, multi-link suspension to locate the rear wheels securely while providing decent ride quality.\n\nThe spring rate (or suspension rate) is a component in setting the vehicle\u0027s ride height or its location in the suspension stroke. When a spring is compressed or stretched, the force it exerts is proportional to its change in length. The spring rate or spring constant of a spring is the change in the force it exerts, divided by the change in deflection of the spring. Vehicles which carry heavy loads will often have heavier springs to compensate for the additional weight that would otherwise collapse a vehicle to the bottom of its travel (stroke). Heavier springs are also used in performance applications where the loading conditions experienced are more extreme.\n\nSprings that are too hard or too soft cause the suspension to become ineffective because they fail to properly isolate the vehicle from the road. Vehicles that commonly experience suspension loads heavier than normal have heavy or hard springs with a spring rate close to the upper limit for that vehicle\u0027s weight. This allows the vehicle to perform properly under a heavy load when control is limited by the inertia of the load. Riding in an empty truck used for carrying loads can be uncomfortable for passengers because of its high spring rate relative to the weight of the vehicle. A race car would also be described as having heavy springs and would also be uncomfortably bumpy. However, even though we say they both have heavy springs, the actual spring rates for a 2,000 lb (910 kg) race car and a 10,000 lb (4,500 kg) truck are very different. A luxury car, taxi, or passenger bus would be described as having soft springs. Vehicles with worn out or damaged springs ride lower to the ground which reduces the overall amount of compression available to the suspension and increases the amount of body lean. Performance vehicles can sometimes have spring rate requirements other than vehicle weight and load.\n\nSpring rate is a ratio used to measure how resistant a spring is to being compressed or expanded during the spring\u0027s deflection. The magnitude of the spring force increases as deflection increases according to Hooke\u0027s Law. Briefly, this can be stated as\n\nwhere\n\nF\n\nis the force the spring exerts\n\nk\n\nis the spring rate of the spring.\n\nx is the deflection of the spring from its equilibrium position (i.e., when no force is applied on the spring)\n\nNegative sign indicates direction of applied force and force exerted by spring are opposite. Spring rate is confined to a narrow interval by the weight of the vehicle, load the vehicle will carry, and to a lesser extent by suspension geometry and performance desires.\n\nSpring rates typically have units of N/mm (or lbf/in). An example of a linear spring rate is 500 lbf/in. For every inch the spring is compressed, it exerts 500 lbf. A non-linear spring rate is one for which the relation between the spring\u0027s compression and the force exerted cannot be fitted adequately to a linear model. For example, the first inch exerts 500 lbf force, the second inch exerts an additional 550 lbf (for a total of 1050 lbf), the third inch exerts another 600 lbf (for a total of 1650 lbf). In contrast a 500 lbf/in linear spring compressed to 3 inches will only exert 1500 lbf.\n\nSpring, wheel, and roll rates\n\nCitroën BX Hydropneumatic suspension - maximum to minimum demonstration Play media\n\nSpring rate\n\nMathematics of the spring rate\n\nThe spring rate of a coil spring may be calculated by a simple algebraic equation or it may be measured in a spring testing machine. The spring constant k can be calculated as follows:\n\nwhere d is the wire diameter, G is the spring\u0027s shear modulus (e.g., about 12,000,000 lbf/in² or 80 GPa for steel), N is the number of wraps and D is the diameter of the coil.\n\nWheel rate is the effective spring rate when measured at the wheel. This is as opposed to simply measuring the spring rate alone.\n\nWheel rate is usually equal to or considerably less than the spring rate. Commonly, springs are mounted on control arms, swing arms or some other pivoting suspension member. Consider the example above where the spring rate was calculated to be 500 lbs/inch (87.5 N/mm), if you were to move the wheel 1 in (2.5 cm) (without moving the car), the spring more than likely compresses a smaller amount. Let\u0027s assume the spring moved 0.75 in (19 mm), the lever arm ratio would be 0.75:1. The wheel rate is calculated by taking the square of the ratio (0.5625) times the spring rate, thus obtaining 281.25 lbs/inch (49.25 N/mm). Squaring the ratio is because the ratio has two effects on the wheel rate. The ratio applies to both the force and distance traveled.\n\nWheel rate on independent suspension is fairly straightforward. However, special consideration must be taken with some non-independent suspension designs. Take the case of the straight axle. When viewed from the front or rear, the wheel rate can be measured by the means above. Yet because the wheels are not independent, when viewed from the side under acceleration or braking the pivot point is at infinity (because both wheels have moved) and the spring is directly inline with the wheel contact patch. The result is often that the effective wheel rate under cornering is different from what it is under acceleration and braking. This variation in wheel rate may be minimized by locating the spring as close to the wheel as possible.\n\nWheel rates are usually summed and compared with the sprung mass of a vehicle to create a \"ride rate\" and corresponding suspension natural frequency in ride (also referred to as \"heave\"). This can be useful in creating a metric for suspension stiffness and travel requirements for a vehicle.\n\nRoll rate is analogous to a vehicle\u0027s ride rate, but for actions that include lateral accelerations, causing a vehicle\u0027s sprung mass to roll about its roll axis. It is expressed as torque per degree of roll of the vehicle sprung mass. It is influenced by factors including but not limited to vehicle sprung mass, track width, CG height, spring and damper rates, roll center heights of front and rear, anti-roll bar stiffness and tire pressure/construction. The roll rate of a vehicle can, and usually does, differ front to rear, which allows for the tuning ability of a vehicle for transient and steady state handling. The roll rate of a vehicle does not change the total amount of weight transfer on the vehicle, but shifts the speed at which and percentage of weight transferred on a particular axle to another axle through the vehicle chassis. Generally, the higher the roll rate on an axle of a vehicle, the faster and higher percentage the weight transfer on that axle.\n\nRoll couple percentage is a simplified method of describing lateral load transfer distribution front to rear, and subsequently handling balance. It is the effective wheel rate, in roll, of each axle of the vehicle as a ratio of the vehicle\u0027s total roll rate. It is commonly adjusted through the use of anti-roll bars, but can also be changed through the use of different springs.\n\nWheel rate\n\nRoll rate\n\nRoll couple percentage\n\nWeight transfer\n\nWeight transfer during cornering, acceleration or braking is usually calculated per individual wheel and compared with the static weights for the same wheels.\n\nThe total amount of weight transfer is only affected by four factors: the distance between wheel centers (wheelbase in the case of braking, or track width in the case of cornering) the height of the center of gravity, the mass of the vehicle, and the amount of acceleration experienced.\n\nThe speed at which weight transfer occurs as well as through which components it transfers is complex and is determined by many factors including but not limited to roll center height, spring and damper rates, anti-roll bar stiffness and the kinematic design of the suspension links. In most conventional applications, when weight is transferred through intentionally compliant elements such as springs, dampers and anti-roll bars, the weight transfer is said to be \"elastic\", while the weight which is transferred through more rigid suspension links such as A-arms and toe links is said to be \"geometric\".\n\nUnsprung weight transfer is calculated based on the weight of the vehicle\u0027s components that are not supported by the springs. This includes tires, wheels, brakes, spindles, half the control arm\u0027s weight and other components. These components are then (for calculation purposes) assumed to be connected to a vehicle with zero sprung weight. They are then put through the same dynamic loads. The weight transfer for cornering in the front would be equal to the total unsprung front weight times the G-Force times the front unsprung center of gravity height divided by the front track width. The same is true for the rear.\n\nSprung weight transfer is the weight transferred by only the weight of the vehicle resting on the springs, not the total vehicle weight. Calculating this requires knowing the vehicle\u0027s sprung weight (total weight less the unsprung weight), the front and rear roll center heights and the sprung center of gravity height (used to calculate the roll moment arm length). Calculating the front and rear sprung weight transfer will also require knowing the roll couple percentage.\n\nThe roll axis is the line through the front and rear roll centers that the vehicle rolls around during cornering. The distance from this axis to the sprung center of gravity height is the roll moment arm length. The total sprung weight transfer is equal to the G-force times the sprung weight times the roll moment arm length divided by the effective track width. The front sprung weight transfer is calculated by multiplying the roll couple percentage times the total sprung weight transfer. The rear is the total minus the front transfer.\n\nJacking forces are the sum of the vertical force components experienced by the suspension links. The resultant force acts to lift the sprung mass if the roll center is above ground, or compress it if underground. Generally, the higher the roll center, the more jacking force is experienced.\n\nTravel is the measure of distance from the bottom of the suspension stroke (such as when the vehicle is on a jack and the wheel hangs freely) to the top of the suspension stroke (such as when the vehicle\u0027s wheel can no longer travel in an upward direction toward the vehicle). Bottoming or lifting a wheel can cause serious control problems or directly cause damage. \"Bottoming\" can be caused by the suspension, tires, fenders, etc. running out of space to move or the body or other components of the car hitting the road. The control problems caused by lifting a wheel are less severe if the wheel lifts when the spring reaches its unloaded shape than they are if travel is limited by contact of suspension members (See Triumph TR3B.) Many off-road vehicles, such as desert racers, use straps\n\nUnsprung weight transfer\n\nSprung weight transfer\n\nJacking forces\n\nOther properties\n\nTravel\n\ncalled \"limiting straps\" to limit the suspensions downward travel to a point within safe limits for the linkages and shock absorbers. This is necessary, since these trucks are intended to travel over very rough terrain at high speeds, and even become airborne at times. Without something to limit the travel, the suspension bushings would take all the force when the suspension reaches \"full droop\", and it can even cause the coil springs to come out of their \"buckets\" if they are held in by compression forces only. A limiting strap is a simple strap, often nylon of a predetermined length, that stops the downward movement at a preset point before the theoretical maximum travel is reached. The opposite of this is the \"bump-stop\", which protects the suspension and vehicle (as well as the occupants) from violent \"bottoming\" of the suspension, caused when an obstruction (or hard landing) causes the suspension to run out of upward travel without fully absorbing the energy of the stroke. Without bump-stops, a vehicle that \"bottoms out\" will experience a very hard shock when the suspension contacts the bottom of the frame or body, which is transferred to the occupants and every connector and weld on the vehicle. Factory vehicles often come with plain rubber \"nubs\" to absorb the worst of the forces, and insulate the shock. A desert race vehicle, which must routinely absorb far higher impact forces, may be provided with pneumatic or hydro-pneumatic bump-stops. These are essentially miniature shock absorbers (dampeners) that are fixed to the vehicle in a location such that the suspension will contact the end of the piston when it nears the upward travel limit. These absorb the impact far more effectively than a solid rubber bump-stop will, essential because a rubber bump-stop is considered a \"last-ditch\" emergency insulator for the occasional accidental bottoming of the suspension; it is entirely insufficient to absorb repeated and heavy bottomings such as a high-speed off-road vehicle encounters.\n\nDamping is the control of motion or oscillation, as seen with the use of hydraulic gates and valves in a vehicle\u0027s shock absorber. This may also vary, intentionally or unintentionally. Like spring rate, the optimal damping for comfort may be less than for control.\n\nDamping controls the travel speed and resistance of the vehicle\u0027s suspension. An undamped car will oscillate up and down. With proper damping levels, the car will settle back to a normal state in a minimal amount of time. Most damping in modern vehicles can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the resistance to fluid flow in the shock absorber.\n\nSee dependent and independent below. Camber changes due to wheel travel, body roll and suspension system deflection or compliance. In general, a tire wears and brakes best at -1 to -2° of camber from vertical. Depending on the tire and the road surface, it may hold the road best at a slightly different angle. Small changes in camber, front and rear, can be used to tune handling. Some race cars are tuned with -2 to -7° camber depending on the type of handling desired and the tire construction. Often, too much camber will result in the decrease of braking performance due to a reduced contact patch size through excessive camber variation in the suspension geometry. The amount of camber change in bump is determined by the instantaneous front view swing arm (FVSA) length of the suspension geometry, or in other words, the tendency of the tire to camber inward when compressed in bump.\n\nRoll center height is a product of suspension instant center heights and is a useful metric in analyzing weight transfer effects, body roll and front to rear roll stiffness distribution. Conventionally, roll stiffness distribution is tuned adjusting antiroll bars rather than roll center height (as both tend to have a similar effect on the sprung mass), but the height of the roll center is significant when considering the amount of jacking forces experienced.\n\nDue to the fact that the wheel and tire\u0027s motion is constrained by the suspension links on the vehicle, the motion of the wheel package in the front view will scribe an imaginary arc in space with an \"instantaneous center\" of rotation at any given point along its path. The instant center for any wheel package can be found by following imaginary lines drawn through the suspension links to their intersection point.\n\nDamping\n\nCamber control\n\nRoll center height\n\nInstant center\n\nA component of the tire\u0027s force vector points from the contact patch of the tire through instant center. The larger this component is, the less suspension motion will occur. Theoretically, if the resultant of the vertical load on the tire and the lateral force generated by it points directly into the instant center, the suspension links will not move. In this case, all weight transfer at that end of the vehicle will be geometric in nature. This is key information used in finding the force-based roll center as well.\n\nIn this respect the instant centers are more important to the handling of the vehicle than the kinematic roll center alone, in that the ratio of geometric to elastic weight transfer is determined by the forces at the tires and their directions in relation to the position of their respective instant centers.\n\nAnti-dive and anti-squat are percentages that indicate the degree to which the front dives under braking and the rear squats under acceleration. They can be thought of as the counterparts for braking and acceleration, as jacking forces are to cornering. The main reason for the difference is due to the different design goals between front and rear suspension, whereas suspension is usually symmetrical between the left and right of the vehicle.\n\nThe method of determining the anti-dive or anti-squat depends on whether the suspension linkages react to the torque of braking and accelerating. For example, with inboard brakes and half-shaft driven rear wheels, the suspension linkages do not, but with outboard brakes and a swing-axle driveline, they do.\n\nTo determine the percentage of front suspension braking anti-dive for outboard brakes, it is first necessary to determine the tangent of the angle between a line drawn, in side view, through the front tire patch and the front suspension instant center, and the horizontal. In addition, the percentage of braking effort at the front wheels must be known. Then, multiply the tangent by the front wheel braking effort percentage and divide by the ratio of the center of gravity height to the wheelbase. A value of 50% would mean that half of the weight transfer to the front wheels, during braking, is being transmitted through the front suspension linkage and half is being transmitted through the front suspension springs.\n\nFor inboard brakes, the same procedure is followed but using the wheel center instead of contact patch center.\n\nForward acceleration anti-squat is calculated in a similar manner and with the same relationship between percentage and weight transfer. Anti-squat values of 100% and more are commonly used in drag racing, but values of 50% or less are more common in cars that have to undergo severe braking. Higher values of anti-squat commonly cause wheel hop during braking. It is important to note that, while the value of 100% means that all of the weight transfer is being carried through the suspension linkage. However, this does not mean that the suspension is incapable of carrying additional loads (aerodynamic, cornering, etc.) during an episode of braking or forward acceleration. In other words, no \"binding\" of the suspension is to be implied.[8]\n\nIn some modern cars, the flexibility is mainly in the rubber bushings, which are subject to decay over time. For high-stress suspensions, such as off-road vehicles, polyurethane bushings are available, which offer more longevity under greater stresses. However, due to weight and cost considerations, structures are not made more rigid than necessary. Some vehicles exhibit detrimental vibrations involving the flexing of structural parts, such as when accelerating while turning sharply. Flexibility of structures such as frames and suspension links can also contribute to springing, especially to damping out high frequency vibrations. The flexibility of wire wheels contributed to their popularity in times when cars had less advanced suspensions.\n\nVariations in suspension design\n\nAnti-dive and anti-squat\n\nFlexibility and vibration modes of the suspension elements\n\nLoad levelling\n\nAutomobiles can be heavily laden with luggage, passengers, and trailers. This loading will cause a vehicle\u0027s tail to sink downwards. Maintaining a steady chassis level is essential to achieving the proper handling the vehicle was designed for. Oncoming drivers can be blinded by the headlight beam. Self-levelling suspension counteracts this by inflating cylinders in the suspension to lift the chassis higher.[9]\n\nFor most purposes, the weight of the suspension components is unimportant, but at high frequencies, caused by road surface roughness, the parts isolated by rubber bushings act as a multistage filter to suppress noise and vibration better than can be done with only the tires and springs. (The springs work mainly in the vertical direction.)\n\nThese are usually small, except that the suspension is related to whether the brakes and differential(s) are sprung.\n\nThis is the main functional advantage of aluminum wheels over steel wheels. Aluminum suspension parts have been used in production cars, and carbon fiber suspension parts are common in racing cars.\n\nDesigns differ as to how much space they take up and where it is located. It is generally accepted that MacPherson struts are the most compact arrangement for front-engined vehicles, where space between the wheels is required to place the engine.\n\nInboard brakes (which reduce unsprung weight) are probably avoided more due to space considerations than to cost.\n\nThe suspension attachment must match the frame design in geometry, strength and rigidity.\n\nCertain modern vehicles have height adjustable suspension in order to improve aerodynamics and fuel efficiency. Modern formula cars that have exposed wheels and suspension typically use streamlined tubing rather than simple round tubing for their suspension arms to reduce aerodynamic drag. Also typical is the use of rocker arm, push rod, or pull rod type suspensions that, among other things, place the spring/damper unit inboard and out of the air stream to further reduce air resistance.\n\nProduction methods improve, but cost is always a factor. The continued use of the solid rear axle, with unsprung differential, especially on heavy vehicles, seems to be the most obvious example.\n\nMost conventional suspensions use passive springs to absorb impacts and dampers (or shock absorbers) to control spring motions.\n\nSome notable exceptions are the hydropneumatic systems, which can be treated as an integrated unit of gas spring and damping components, used by the French manufacturer Citroën and the hydrolastic, hydragas and rubber cone systems used by the British Motor Corporation, most notably on the Mini. A number of different types of each have been used:\n\nIsolation from high frequency shock\n\nContribution to unsprung weight and total weight\n\nSpace occupied\n\nForce distribution\n\nAir resistance (drag)\n\nCost\n\nSprings and dampers\n\nPassive suspensions\n\nTraditional springs and dampers are referred to as passive suspensions - most vehicles are suspended in this manner.\n\nThe majority of land vehicles are suspended by steel springs, of these types:\n\nLeaf spring - AKA Hotchkiss, Cart, or semi-elliptical spring[4] Torsion beam suspension[10]\n\nCoil spring[11]\n\nAutomakers are aware of the inherent limitations of steel springs, that they tend to produce undesirable oscillations, and have developed other types of suspension materials and mechanisms in attempts to improve performance:\n\nRubber bushing[12]\n\nGas under pressure - air spring[13]\n\nGas and hydraulic fluid under pressure - hydropneumatic suspension[14] and oleo strut\n\nThe shock absorbers damp out the (otherwise simple harmonic) motions of a vehicle up and down on its springs. They also must damp out much of the wheel bounce when the unsprung weight of a wheel, hub, axle and sometimes brakes and differential bounces up and down on the springiness of a tire. Some have suggested that the regular bumps found on dirt roads (nicknamed \"corduroy\", but properly corrugations or washboarding) are caused by this wheel bounce, though some evidence exists that it is unrelated to suspension at all. (See washboarding.)\n\nIf the suspension is externally controlled then it is a semi-active or active suspension - the suspension is reacting to signals from an electronic controller.\n\nFor example, a hydropneumatic Citroën will \"know\" how far off the ground the car is supposed to be and constantly reset to achieve that level, regardless of load. It will not instantly compensate for body roll due to cornering however. Citroën\u0027s system adds about 1% to the cost of the car versus passive steel springs.\n\nSemi-active suspensions include devices such as air springs and switchable shock absorbers, various self-levelling solutions, as well as systems like hydropneumatic, hydrolastic, and hydragas suspensions. Mitsubishi developed the world\u0027s first production semi-active electronically controlled suspension system in passenger cars; the system was first incorporated in the 1987 Galant model.[15][16][17][18][19] Delphi currently sells shock absorbers filled with a magneto-rheological fluid, whose viscosity can be changed electromagnetically, thereby giving variable control without switching valves, which is faster and thus more effective.\n\nFully active suspension systems use electronic monitoring of vehicle conditions, coupled with the means to impact vehicle suspension and behavior in real time to directly control the motion of the car. Lotus Cars developed several prototypes, from 1982 onwards, and introduced them to F1, where they have been fairly effective, but have now been banned. Nissan introduced a low bandwidth active suspension in circa 1990 as an option that added an extra 20% to the price of luxury models. Citroën has also developed several active suspension models (see hydractive). A recently publicised fully active system from Bose Corporation uses linear electric motors (i.e., solenoids) in place of hydraulic or pneumatic actuators that have generally been used up until recently. Mercedes introduced an active suspension system called Active Body Control in its top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benz CL-Class in 1999.\n\nSeveral electromagnetic suspensions have also been developed for vehicles. Examples include the electromagnetic suspension of Bose, and the electromagnetic suspension developed by prof. Laurentiu Encica. In addition, the new Michelin wheel with embedded suspension working on an electromotor is also similar.[20]\n\nSprings\n\nPneumatic spring on a semitrailer\n\nDampers or shock absorbers\n\nSemi-active and active suspensions\n\nWith the help of control system, various semi-active/active suspensions realize an improved design compromise among different vibrations modes of the vehicle, namely bounce, roll, pitch and warp modes. However, the applications of these advanced suspensions are constrained by the cost, packaging, weight, reliability, and/or the other challenges.\n\nInterconnected suspension, unlike semi-active/active suspensions, could easily decouple different vehicle vibration modes in a passive manner. The interconnections can be realized by various means, such as mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic. Anti-roll bars are one of the typical examples of mechanical interconnections, while it has been stated that fluidic interconnections offer greater potential and flexibility in improving both the stiffness and damping properties.\n\nConsidering the considerable commercial potentials of hydro-pneumatic technology (Corolla, 1996), interconnected hydropneumatic suspensions have also been explored in some recent studies, and their potential benefits in enhancing vehicle ride and handling have been demonstrated. The control system can also be used for further improving performance of interconnected suspensions. Apart from academic research, an Australian company, Kinetic,[21] had some success (WRC: 3 Championships, Dakar Rally: 2 Championships, Lexus GX470 2004 4×4 of the year with KDSS, 2005 PACE award) with various passive or semi-active systems, which generally decouple at least two vehicle modes (roll, warp (articulation), pitch and/or heave (bounce)) to simultaneously control each mode\u0027s stiffness and damping, by using interconnected shock absorbers, and other methods. In 1999, Kinetic was bought out by Tenneco. Later developments by a Catalan company, Creuat has devised a simpler system design based on single-acting cylinders. After some projects on competition Creuat is active in providing retrofit systems for some vehicle models.\n\nHistorically, the first mass production car with front to rear mechanical interconnected suspension was the 1948 Citroën 2CV. The suspension of the 2CV was extremely soft-the longitudinal link was making pitch softer instead of making roll stiffer. It relied on extreme antidive and antisquat geometries to compensate for that. This redunded into a softer axle crossing stiffness that anti-roll bars would have otherwise compromised. The leading arm / trailing arm swinging arm, fore-aft linked suspension system together with inboard front brakes had a much smaller unsprung weight than existing coil spring or leaf designs. The interconnection transmitted some of the force deflecting a front wheel up over a bump, to push the rear wheel down on the same side. When the rear wheel met that bump a moment later, it did the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. The 2CV had a design brief to be able to be driven at speed over a ploughed field. It originally featured friction dampers and tuned mass dampers. Later models had tuned mass dampers at the front with telescopic dampers/shock absorbers front and rear.\n\nThe British Motor Corporation was also an early adopter of interconnected suspension. A system dubbed Hydrolastic was introduced in 1962 on the Morris 1100 and went on to be used on a variety of BMC models. Hydrolastic was developed by suspension engineer Alex Moulton and used rubber cones as the springing medium (these were first used on the 1959 Mini) with the suspension units on each side connected to each other by a fluid filled pipe. The fluid transmitted the force of road bumps from one wheel to the other (on the same principle as the Citroen 2CV\u0027s mechanical system described above) and because each suspension unit contained valves to restrict the flow of fluid also served as a shock absorber.[22] Moulton went on to develop a replacement for Hydrolastic for BMC\u0027s successor, British Leyland. This system manufactured under licence by Dunlop in Coventry, called Hydragas worked on the same principle but instead of rubber spring units it used metal spheres divided internally by a rubber diaphragm. The top half contained pressurised gas and the lower half the same fluid as used on the Hydrolastic system. The fluid transmitted suspension forces between the units on each side whilst the gas acted as the springing medium via the diaphragm. This is the same principle as the Citroen hydropneumatic system and provides a similar ride quality but is self-contained and doesn\u0027t require an engine-driven pump to provide hydraulic pressure. The downside is that Hydragas is, unlike the Citroen system, not height adjustable or self-levelling. Hydragas was introduced in 1973 on the Austin Allegro and was used on several models, the last car to use it being the MG F in 2002. The system was changed in favour of coil springs over dampers, due to cost reasons, towards the end of the vehicle\u0027s life. When it was decommissioned in 2006 the Hydragas manufacturing line was over 40 years old.\n\nSome of the last post-war Packard models also featured interconnected suspension.\n\nInterconnected suspensions\n\nSuspension geometry\n\nSuspension systems can be broadly classified into two subgroups: dependent and independent. These terms refer to the ability of opposite wheels to move independently of each other.\n\nA dependent suspension normally has a beam (a simple \u0027cart\u0027 axle) or (driven) live axle that holds wheels parallel to each other and perpendicular to the axle. When the camber of one wheel changes, the camber of the opposite wheel changes in the same way (by convention on one side this is a positive change in camber and on the other side this a negative change). De Dion suspensions are also in this category as they rigidly connect the wheels together.\n\nAn independent suspension allows wheels to rise and fall on their own without affecting the opposite wheel. Suspensions with other devices, such as sway bars that link the wheels in some way are still classed as independent.\n\nA third type is a semi-dependent suspension. In this case, the motion of one wheel does affect the position of the other but they are not rigidly attached to each other. A twist-beam rear suspension is such a system.\n\nDependent systems may be differentiated by the system of linkages used to locate them, both longitudinally and transversely. Often both functions are combined in a set of linkages.\n\nExamples of location linkages include:\n\nSatchell link Panhard rod Watt\u0027s linkage WOBLink Mumford linkage\n\nLeaf springs used for location (transverse or longitudinal)\n\nFully elliptical springs usually need supplementary location links and are no longer in common use\n\nLongitudinal semi-elliptical springs used to be common and still are used in heavy-duty trucks and aircraft. They have the advantage that the spring rate can easily be made progressive (non-linear).\n\nA single transverse leaf spring for both front wheels and/or both back wheels, supporting solid axles, was used by Ford Motor Company, before and soon after World War II, even on expensive models. It had the advantages of simplicity and low unsprung weight (compared to other solid axle designs).\n\nIn a front engine, rear-drive vehicle, dependent rear suspension is either \"live axle\" or deDion axle, depending on whether or not the differential is carried on the axle. Live axle is simpler but the unsprung weight contributes to wheel bounce.\n\nBecause it assures constant camber, dependent (and semi-independent) suspension is most common on vehicles that need to carry large loads as a proportion of the vehicle weight, that have relatively soft springs and that do not (for cost and simplicity reasons) use active suspensions. The use of dependent front suspension has become limited to heavier commercial vehicles.\n\nCommon types seen from behind; in order: Live axle with Watt bar Suspension like on a bike fork Swing axle Double wishbone suspension MacPherson This diagram is not exhaustive; notably excluding elements such as trailing arm links and those that are flexible.\n\nDependent suspensions\n\nIndependent suspensions\n\nThe variety of independent systems is greater and includes:\n\nSwing axle Sliding pillar MacPherson strut/Chapman strut\n\nUpper and lower A-arm (double wishbone)\n\nMulti-link suspension\n\nSemi-trailing arm suspension\n\nSwinging arm\n\nLeaf springs\n\nTransverse leaf springs when used as a suspension link, or four quarter elliptics on one end of a car are similar to wishbones in geometry, but are more compliant. Examples are the front of the original Fiat 500, the Panhard Dyna Z and the early examples of Peugeot 403 and the back of the AC Ace and AC Aceca.\n\nBecause the wheels are not constrained to remain perpendicular to a flat road surface in turning, braking and varying load conditions, control of the wheel camber is an important issue. Swinging arm was common in small cars that were sprung softly and could carry large loads, because the camber is independent of load. Some active and semi-active suspensions maintain the ride height, and therefore the camber, independent of load. In sports cars, optimal camber change when turning is more important.\n\nWishbone and multi-link allow the engineer more control over the geometry, to arrive at the best compromise, than swing axle, MacPherson strut or swinging arm do; however the cost and space requirements may be greater. Semi-trailing arm is in between, being a variable compromise between the geometries of swinging arm and swing axle.\n\nIn a semi-independent suspensions, the wheels of an axle are able to move relative to one another as in an independent suspension but the position of one wheel has an effect on the position and attitude of the other wheel. This effect is achieved via the twisting or deflecting of suspension parts under load. The most common type of semi-independent suspension is the twist beam.\n\nTwist beam\n\nTilting Suspension System[23] (Also known as Leaning Suspension System) is not actually a different type or different geometry of construction, moreover it is a technology addition to the conventional suspension system.\n\nThis kind of suspension system mainly consist of independent suspension (e.g., MacPherson strut, A-arm (double wishbone)). With addition with these suspension system there is a further tilting or leaning mechanism which connects the suspension system with the vehicle body (chassis).\n\nThis kind of suspension system improves stability, traction, turning radius of vehicle and comfort of riders as well. While turning right or left passengers or objects on a vehicle feel G-force or inertial force outward the radius of curvature that is why Two Wheeler riders lean towards the center of curvature while turning which improves stability and decrease the chances of toppling. But for vehicle more than two wheels and with conventional suspension system could not do the same till now so the passengers feel the outward inertial force which reduce the stability of passengers and comfort as well. This kind of tilting suspension system is the solution of the problem. If the road do not have super-elevation or banking it will not affect the comfort with this suspension system, the vehicle tilt and decrease the height of center of gravity with increase the stability. This is also used in fun vehicle.\n\nSome trains also use tilting suspension (Tilting Train) with increase the speed at cornering.\n\nA rear independent suspension on an AWD car.\n\nSemi-independent suspension\n\nTilting Suspension System\n\nRocker bogie mechanism\n\nThe rocker-bogie system is the suspension arrangement in which there are some trailing arm fitted with some idler wheels, due to the articulation between the driving section and the followers this suspension is very flexible. this kind of suspension is appropriate for extremely rough terrain.\n\nThis kind of suspension was used in the Curiosity rover.\n\nSome vehicles such as trains run on long rail tracks fixed to the ground, and some such as tractors, snow vehicles and tanks run on continuous tracks that are part of the vehicle. Though either sort helps to smooth the path and reduce ground pressure, many of the same considerations apply.\n\nMilitary AFVs, including tanks, have specialized suspension requirements. They can weigh more than seventy tons and are required to move as quickly as possible over very rough or soft ground. Their suspension components must be protected from land mines and antitank weapons. Tracked AFVs can have as many as nine road wheels on each side. Many wheeled AFVs have six or eight large wheels. Some have a Central Tire Inflation System to reduce ground loading on poor surfaces. Some wheels are too big and confined to turn, so skid steering is used with some wheeled, as well as with tracked, vehicles.\n\nThe earliest tanks of World War I had fixed suspension with no designed movement whatsoever. This unsatisfactory situation was improved with leaf spring or coil spring suspensions adopted from agricultural, automotive or railway machinery, but even these had very limited travel.\n\nSpeeds increased due to more powerful engines, and the quality of ride had to be improved. In the 1930s, the Christie suspension was developed, which allowed the use of coil springs inside a vehicle\u0027s armored hull, by changing the direction of force deforming the spring, using a bell crank. The T-34\u0027s suspension was directly descended from Christie designs. Horstmann suspension was a variation which used a combination of bell crank and exterior coil springs, in use from the 1930s to the 1990s. The bogie, but nonetheless independent, suspension of the M3 Lee/Grant and the M4 Sherman was similar to the Hortsmann type, with the suspension contained within the track oval.\n\nBy World War II the other common type was torsion bar suspension, getting spring force from twisting bars inside the hull - this sometimes had less travel than the Christie-type, but was significantly more compact, allowing more space inside the hull, with consequent possibility to install larger turret rings and thus a heavier main armament. The torsion-bar suspension, sometimes including shock absorbers, has been the dominant heavy armored vehicle suspension since World War II. Torsion bars may take space under or near the floor, which may interfere with making the tank low to reduce exposure.\n\nAs with cars, wheel travel and spring rate affect the bumpiness of the ride and the speed at which rough terrain can be negotiated. It may be significant that a smooth ride, which is often associated with comfort, increases the accuracy when firing on the move (analogously to battle ships with reduced stability, due to reduced metacentric height). It also reduces shock on optics and other equipment. The unsprung weight and track link weight may limit speed on roads and affect the life of the track and other components.\n\nMost German WW II half tracks and their tanks introduced during the war such as the Panther tank had overlapping and sometimes interleaved road wheels to distribute the load more evenly on the track and therefore on the ground. This apparently made a significant contribution to speed, range and track life, as well as providing a continuous band of protection. It has not been used since the end of that war, probably due to the maintenance requirements of more complicated mechanical parts working in mud, sand,\n\nTracked vehicles\n\nArmoured fighting vehicle suspension\n\nThis Grant I tank\u0027s suspension has road wheels mounted on wheel trucks, or bogies.\n\nrocks, snow and ice, as well as to cost. Rocks and frozen mud often got stuck between the overlapping wheels, which could prevent them from turning or cause damage to the road wheels. If one of the interior road wheels were damaged, it would require other road wheels to be removed in order to access the damaged road wheel, making the process more complicated and time-consuming.[24]\n\n4-poster - a test rig\n\n7 post shaker - a test rig for high speed vehicles Automotive suspension design - the design process Caster angle - self centering steering Coilover\n\nCorvette leaf spring - independent suspension combined with a transverse fiber reinforced plastic leaf spring Korres P4 - a Greek all-terrain supercar, with a unique suspension\n\nMagnetic levitation Maglev train Scrub radius\n\nShort long arms suspension - also known as \"unequal length A arm\", one of the design parameters of double wishbone suspension\n\nStrut bar - a form of semi-independent suspension\n\nOleo strut - design used in most large aircraft, with compressed gas and hydraulic fluid - conceptually similar to automobile Hydropneumatic suspension\n\n1.

For example, by means of the body style and the \"level of commonality in vehicle construction as defined by number of doors and roof treatment (e.g., sedan, convertible, fastback, hatchback) and number of seats\" that require seat belts to meet safety regulations.[1]\n\nRegulatory agencies may also establish a vehicle classification system for determining a tax amount. In the United Kingdom, a vehicle is taxed according to the vehicle\u0027s construction, engine, weight, type of fuel and emissions, as well as the purpose for which it is used.[2] Other jurisdictions may determine vehicle tax based upon environmental principles, such as the user pays principle.[3] In another example, certain cities in the United States in the 1920s chose to exempt electric-powered vehicles because officials believed those vehicles did not cause \"substantial wear upon the pavements\".[4]\n\nAnother standard for road vehicles of all types that is used internationally (except for Australia, India, and the U.S.) is ISO 3833-1977.[5]\n\nIn an example from private enterprise, many car rental companies use the ACRISS Car Classification Code to describe the size, type and equipment of vehicles to ensure that rental agents can match customer needs to available vehicles, regardless of distance between the agent and the rental company or the languages spoken by either party. In the United States, since 2010 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety uses a scheme it has developed that takes into account a combination of both vehicle shadow (length times width) and weight.[6]\n\nUS Highway Loss Data Institute classification Definition\n\nRegular Two Door Two door sedans and hatchbacks\n\nRegular Four Door Four door sedans and hatchbacks\n\nStation Wagons Four doors, a rear hatch and four pillars\n\nMinivans Vans with sliding rear doors\n\nSports Two seaters and cars with significant high performance features\n\nLuxury Relatively expensive cars that are not classified as sports (price in USD to curb weight in pounds more than 9.0 in 2010) (small cars over $27,000, midsize cars over $31,500, large cars over $36,000, etc.)\n\nUS Insurance Institute for Highway Safety | Highway Loss Data Institute \u0027Guide to car size groups\u0027 (includes minivans)[7]\n\nShadow (square footage of exterior length × width)\n\nCurb Weight 70 to 80 sq ft(6.5-7.4 m2) 81 to 90 sq ft (7.5-8.4 m2) 91 to 100 sq ft (8.5-9.3 m2) 101 to 110 sq ft (9.4-10.2 m2) \u003e110 sq ft (10.2 m2)\n\n2,001 to 2,500 lb (900-1,150 kg) Mini Small Small Small Midsize\n\n2,501 to 3,000 lb (1,150-1,350 kg) Small Small Midsize Midsize Midsize\n\n3,001 to 3,500 lb (1,350-1,600 kg) Small Midsize Midsize Large Large\n\n3,501 to 4,000 lb (1,600-1,800 kg) Small Midsize Large Large Very Large\n\n\u003e4,000 lb (1,800 kg) Midsize Midsize Large Very Large Very Large\n\nUS IIHS|HLDI Guide to SUV size groups[8]\n\ncurb weight\n\nMini \u003c\u003d3,000 lb (1,350 kg) and shadow \u003c80 sq ft (7.4 m2)\n\nSmall 3,001 to 3,750 lb (1,350-1,700 kg)\n\nMidsize 3,751 to 4,750 lb (1,700-2,150 kg)\n\nLarge 4,751 to 5,750 lb (2,150-2,600 kg)\n\nVery large \u003e5,750 lb (2,600 kg) or shadow \u003e115 sq ft (10.7 m2)\n\nThe United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) separates vehicles into classes by the curb weight of the vehicle with standard equipment including the maximum capacity of fuel, oil, coolant, and air conditioning, if so equipped.[9]\n\nUS NHTSA classification Code Curb weight\n\nPassenger cars: mini PC/Mi 1,500 to 1,999 lb (700-900 kg)\n\nPassenger cars: light PC/L 2,000 to 2,499 lb (900-1,150 kg)\n\nPassenger cars: compact PC/C 2,500 to 2,999 lb (1,150-1,350 kg)\n\nPassenger cars: medium PC/Me 3,000 to 3,499 lb (1,350-1,600 kg)\n\nPassenger cars: heavy PC/H 3,500 lb (1,600 kg) and over\n\nSport utility vehicles SUV -\n\nPickup trucks PU -\n\nVans VAN -\n\nThe United States Federal Highway Administration has developed a classification scheme used for automatically calculating road use tolls. There are two broad categories depending on whether the vehicle carries passengers or commodities. Vehicles that carry commodities are further subdivided by number of axles and number of units, including both power and trailer units.[10]\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has developed a classification scheme used to compare fuel economy among similar vehicles. Passenger vehicles are classified based on a vehicle\u0027s total interior passenger and cargo volumes. Trucks are classified based upon their gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). Heavy duty vehicles are not included within the EPA scheme.[11]\n\nUS EPA car class Total passenger and cargo volume (cu. ft.)\n\nTwo-seaters Any (designed to seat only two adults) Less than 85 cu ft (2,400 l) 85 to 99 cu ft (2,400-2,800 l) 100 to 109 cu ft (2,850-3,100 l) 110 to 119 cu ft (3,100-3,350 l) 120 cu ft (3,400 l) or more Less than 130 cu ft (3,700 l) 130 to 159 cu ft (3,700-4,500 l)\n\nMinicompact\n\nSubcompact\n\nCompact\n\nMid-size\n\nLarge\n\nMid-size station wagons\n\nLarge station wagons 160 cu ft (4,550 l) or more\n\nSmall station wagons\n\nA similar set of classes is used by the Canadian EPA.[12] The Canadian National Collision Database (NCDB) system defines \"passenger car\" as a unique class, but also identifies two other categories involving passenger vehicles-the \"passenger van\" and \"light utility vehicle\"-and these categories are inconsistently handled across the country with the boundaries between the vehicles increasingly blurred.[13]\n\nIn Australia, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries publishes its own classifications.[14]\n\nThis is a summary table listing several diferent methods of vehicle classification.\n\nSize and usage-based vehicle classification systems worldwide\n\nNot well-defined / vernacular Defined by law or regulation\n\nExamples Market segment (American English)\n\nMarket segment (British English)\n\nMarket segment (Australian English)[15]\n\nUS EPA Size Class [16]\n\nEuro NCAP Structural Category [17]\n\nEuro NCAP Class (1997- 2009)\n\nEuro Market Segment [18]\n\nMicrocar Microcar,Bubble car N/A N/A -

Some microcars are three-wheelers, while the majority have four wheels. Microcars were popular in post-war Europe, where their appearance led them to be called \"Bubble cars\". More recent microcars are often electric powered.\n\nExamples of microcars:\n\nIsetta Smart Fortwo Tata Nano\n\nIn 2012, Japan\u0027s Transport and Tourism Ministry allowed local government to use ultracompact cars as transport for residents and tourists in their limiting areas. The size of ultracompact cars will be less than minicars, but have engine greater than 50cc displacement and able to transport 1 or 2 persons. Ultracompact cars cannot use minicars standard, because of strict safety standards for minicars. The regulation about running capacity and safety performance of ultracompact cars will be published in early autumn. Today, there are cars smaller than ultracompact cars, called category-1 motorized vehicles which it has 50cc displacement or less and only one seat for the driver.[19]\n\nA city car is a small automobile intended for use in urban areas. Unlike microcars, a city car\u0027s greater speed, capacity and (in perception at least) occupant protection are safer in mixed traffic environments and weather conditions. While city cars can reach highway speeds, that is not their intended use. In Japan, city cars are called kei cars.[20] Kei cars have to meet strict size and engine requirements: engines have a maximum displacement of 660 cc and the car\u0027s length must be under 3400 mm.\n\nExamples of kei cars:\n\nDaihatsu Move\n\nEconomy car\n\nMicrocar\n\nMicrocar Abaca\n\nHatchbacks\n\nUltracompact car\n\nCity car\n\nCitroën C1\n\nHonda Life\n\nSuzuki Cervo Examples of city cars:\n\nFiat Panda Maruti 800\n\nMini (Original 1959 model) Other small cars:\n\nCarver One Citroën Type C Smith Flyer\n\nThis class is known as supermini in the UK, subcompact in North America. Superminis have three, four or five doors, and even as an estate shape. They are designed to seat four passengers comfortably. Current supermini hatchbacks are approximately 3900 mm long, while saloons and estate cars are around 4200 mm long. Currently (2013) sedan variants are generally not available in Europe and are marketed at a lower price than hatchback models in North America.\n\nIn Europe, the first superminis were the Fiat 500 of 1957 and the Austin Mini of 1959. Superminis can be premium cars, such as the Citroën DS3, named 2010 Car of the Year by\n\nTop Gear Magazine. Superminis are some of the best selling vehicles in Europe with 25% of the market shares (2013). In 2007, the Peugeot 207 has been the most sold car in Europe, whereas the best seller is almost systematically a car from the compact segment.\n\nIn Australia, the motoring press tends to distinguish between a light car such as the Daihatsu Charade or early models of the Holden Barina, and slightly larger models such as the Ford Fiesta which is considered to be a small car. As the general size of vehicles in this class has gradually increased, the category of light car has almost disappeared.\n\nExamples of superminis/subcompact cars:\n\nOpel Corsa Peugeot 208 Volkswagen Polo\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Superminis\".\n\nSmall family/compact cars refer to the hatchbacks and shortest saloons and estate cars with similar size. They are approximately 4,250 mm (167 in) long in case of hatchbacks and 4,500 mm (177 in) in the case of saloons and estate cars. Compact cars have room for five adults and usually have engines between 1.4 and 2.2 litres, but some have engines of up to 2.5 litres.\n\nExamples of hatchback small family cars/compact cars:\n\nPeugeot 308 Toyota Auris Renault Megane\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Small Family Cars\". In Australia, this class is generally referred to as being small-medium sized cars.\n\nSupermini/subcompact car\n\nRenault Clio IV\n\nFamily car\n\nSmall family car/compact car\n\nVolkswagen Golf\n\nTraditionally, mid-size cars are sedans, but recently cars such as the Citroën DS5, which is a large hatchback family car, have introduced other body styles.[21]\n\nA class described as \"large family\" in Europe and \"mid-size\" in the USA, these cars have room for five adults and a large trunk (boot). Engines are more powerful than small family/compact cars and six-cylinder engines are more common than in smaller cars. Car sizes vary from region to region; in Europe, large family cars are rarely over 4,700 mm (15.4 ft) long, while in North America, Middle East and Australasia they may be well over 4,800 mm (15.7 ft).\n\nExamples of large family cars/mid-size cars:\n\nChevrolet Malibu Ford Mondeo Kia Optima\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Large Family Cars\". These are known in Australia as Medium sized cars.\n\nThis term is used most in North America, Middle East and Australia where it refers to the largest affordable sedans on the market. Full-size cars may be well over 4,900 mm (16.1 ft) long.\n\nExamples of full-size cars:\n\nDodge Charger Ford Falcon Toyota Avalon [22]\n\nCrossover SUVs are derived from an automobile platform using a monocoque construction with light off-road capability and lower ground clearance than SUVs. They may be styled similar to conventional \"off-roaders\", or may be look similar to an estate car or station wagon.\n\nExamples of crossover SUVs:\n\nChevrolet Equinox Nissan Qashqai Tata Aria\n\nLarge family / mid-size\n\nCitroën DS5\n\nSaloons / sedans\n\nLarge family / mid-size\n\nToyota Camry\n\nFull size / large\n\nHolden Commodore\n\nCrossover SUV\n\nMitsubishi Outlander\n\nAlso known as \"people carriers\", this class of cars resembles tall estate cars. Larger MPVs may have seating for up to eight passengers. (Beyond that size, similar vehicles tend to be derived from vans (see below) and in Europe are called minibuses.)\n\nBeing taller than a family car improves visibility for the driver (while reducing visibility for other road users) and may help access for the elderly or disabled. They also offer more seats and increased load capacity than hatchbacks or estate cars.\n\nExamples of mini MPVs:\n\nCitroën C3 Picasso Ford B-Max Nissan Note Examples of compact MPVs:\n\nOpel Zafira Tourer Peugeot 5008 Renault Scénic\n\nBoth categories are equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Small MPVs\".\n\nExamples of large MPVs / minivans:\n\nDodge Caravan Ford S-Max Mazda5\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"MPVs\".\n\nThese are luxurious equivalents to mid-size and compact cars. Rear seat room and trunk space are smaller than executive cars simply because of their smaller overall size.\n\nExamples of compact premium cars/entry-level luxury cars:\n\nAudi A4 BMW 3 Series Buick Regal\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Large Family Cars\".\n\nThese are luxurious equivalents to full-size cars. This also refers to the largest hatchbacks within the similar length in this class, such as the Porsche Panamera.\n\nExamples of executive cars/mid-luxury cars:\n\nPeugeot 607 Jaguar XF MG Magnette\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Executive Cars\".\n\nMinivans / MPVs\n\nRenault Espace, one of the first true minivans\n\nFord C-Max, a compact MPV\n\nOpel Meriva a mini MPV\n\nLuxury vehicle\n\nCompact executive\n\nLexus IS\n\nExecutive/mid-luxury\n\nBMW 5 Series\n\nFull-size luxury / Grand saloon\n\nAlso known as full-size luxury cars, grand saloons, or premium large cars, while\n\n\"Oberklasse\" is used in Germany. Typically a four-door saloon (sedan). These are the most powerful saloons, with six, eight and twelve-cylinder engines and have more equipment than smaller models. Vehicles in this category include some of the models from the flagship lines of luxury car brands, such as Cadillac CT6,[23] Lincoln Town Car and Maserati Quattroporte.\n\nExamples of grand saloons:\n\nAudi A8 Lexus LS BMW 7 Series\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Executive Cars\".\n\nA station wagon (also known as an estate or estate car) is an automobile with a body style variant of a sedan/saloon with its roof extended rearward over a shared passenger/cargo volume with access at the back via a third or fifth door (the liftgate or tailgate), instead of a trunk lid. The body style transforms a standard three-box design into a two-box design-to include an A, B, and C-pillar, as well as a D-pillar. Station wagons can flexibly reconfigure their interior volume via fold-down rear seats to prioritize either passenger or cargo volume.\n\nExamples of estates/station wagons:\n\nHyundai i40 Tourer Jaguar XF Sportbrake Mercedes-Benz CLS Shooting Brake\n\nA hot hatch is a high-performance hatchback, based on standard superminis or small family cars with improved performance, handling and styling. Hot hatches are very popular in Europe, where hatchbacks are by far the most common body style for this size of car. In North America, sport compacts are usually sold as saloons or coupés rather than hatchbacks.\n\nExamples of hot hatches:\n\nVolkswagen Golf GTi Peugeot 205 GTi Fiat 500 Abarth\n\nThese are high-performance versions of saloons. Sometimes originally homologated for production based motorsports (touring cars or rally cars) and like regular saloons, seats four or five people.\n\nExamples of sports saloons/sedans:\n\nBMW M5 Mazdaspeed6/Mazda 6 MPS Dodge Charger Examples of sport compact saloons/sedans:\n\nMercedes-Benz S-Class\n\nEstate cars / station wagons\n\nAudi A6 avant\n\nSports cars\n\nHot hatch\n\nPeugeot 205 GTI crowned \"The Greatest Ever Hot Hatch\"[24]\n\nSports saloon / sports sedan\n\nPontiac G8 GT\n\nDodge SRT-4\n\nLotus Cortina\n\nMitsubishi EVO\n\nThe term \"sports car\" does not appear to have a clear definition.[25] It is commonly used to describe vehicles which prioritise acceleration and handling; however, some people claim it is also defined as a vehicle with two seats.[26]\n\nA Sports car (sportscar or sport car) is a small, usually two-seat, two-door automobile designed for spirited performance and nimble handling.[27] Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious but high maneuverability and minimum weight are requisite.[28]\n\nExamples of sports cars:\n\nChevrolet Corvette Mazda MX-5 Porsche 911\n\nLarger, more powerful and heavier than sports cars, these vehicles typically have a FR layout and seating for four passengers (2+2). These are more expensive than sports cars but not as expensive as supercars. Grand Tourers encompass both luxury and high-performance. Some grand tourers are hand-built.\n\nExamples of grand tourers:\n\nAston Martin V8 Lexus SC300/400 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti\n\nSupercar is a term generally used for ultra-high-end exotic cars, whose performance is superior to that of its contemporaries. The proper application of the term is subjective and disputed, especially among enthusiasts.\n\nExamples of supercars:\n\nMcLaren P1 Koenigsegg Agera R Bugatti Veyron 16.4\n\nThe muscle car term generally refers to rear wheel drive mid-size cars with powerful V8 engines, typically manufactured in the U.S.[29][30] Some definitions limit it to two-door vehicles;[31] however, others include four-door body style versions.[32] Although opinions vary, it is generally accepted that classic muscle cars were produced in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[33][34][35][36] Muscle cars were also produced in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and other nations.\n\nExamples of American muscle cars from the 1960s and 1970s:\n\nFord Torino Plymouth Road Runner\n\nSports car\n\nJaguar E-Type\n\nGrand tourer\n\nMaserati GranTurismo\n\nSupercar\n\nLamborghini Countach\n\nMuscle car\n\n1970 AMC The Machine\n\nPontiac GTO Examples of Australian muscle cars:\n\nFord Falcon Holden Monaro Valiant Charger\n\nThe pony car is a class of American Muscle car[37] automobile launched and inspired by the Ford Mustang in 1964. It describes an affordable, compact, highly styled car with a sporty or performance-oriented image.[38][39]\n\nExamples of pony cars:\n\nAMC Javelin Chevrolet Camaro Dodge Challenger\n\nA body design that features a flexibly operating roof for open or enclosed mode driving. Also known as a cabriolet or roadster (if a 2-seater). Historically, convertibles used folding roof structures with fabric or other flexible materials. Some designs have roofs made of metal or other stiff materials that retract into the body.\n\nExamples of cabriolets:\n\nMazda MX-5 Honda S2000 Volvo C70\n\nOff-road vehicles, or \"off-roaders\" are sometimes referred to as \"four-wheel drives\", \"four by fours\", or 4x4s - this can happen colloquially in cases where certain models or even an entire range does not possess four-wheel drive.\n\nSport utility vehicles are off-road vehicles with four-wheel drive and true off-road capability. They most often feature high ground clearance and an upright, boxy body design. Sport Utilities are typically defined by a body on frame construction which offers more off-road capability but reduced on-road ride comfort and handling compared to a cross-over or car based utility vehicle.\n\nExamples of compact SUVs:\n\nLand Rover Freelander Jeep Patriot\n\nToyota FJ Cruiser\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Small Off-Roaders\".\n\nPony car\n\n1966 Ford Mustang\n\nConvertible\n\nFull-sized convertible with its fabric covered top folded behind the rear seat\n\nOff-roaders\n\nSport utility vehicle\n\nJeep Commander\n\nExamples of SUVs:\n\nLand Rover Discovery Mitsubishi Pajero Mahindra Scorpio\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Large Off-Roaders\".\n\nIn some countries, the term \"van\" can refer to a small panel van based on a passenger car design (often the estate model / station wagon); it also refers to light trucks, which themselves are sometimes based on SUVs or MPVs. (But note that those retaining seats and windows, while being larger and more utilitarian than MPVs, may be called \"minibuses\".) The term is also used in the term \"camper van\" (or just \"camper\") - equivalent to a North American recreational vehicle (RV).\n\nIn the United States, the term \"van\" refers to vehicles that, like European minibuses, are even larger than large MPVs and are rarely seen being driven for domestic purposes - except for \"conversion vans\". These possess extremely large interior space and are often more intended for hauling cargo than people. Most vans use body-on-frame construction and are thus suitable for extensive modification and coachwork, known as conversion. Conversion vans are often quite luxurious, boasting comfortable seats, soft rides, built-in support for electronics such as television sets, and other amenities. The more elaborate conversion vans straddle the line between cars and recreational vehicles.\n\nExamples of North American \"vans\":\n\nDodge Ram Van Ford E-Series GMC Savana Examples of European \"vans\":\n\nFord Transit Volkswagen Transporter Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Examples of Japanese \"vans\"\n\nToyota Hiace Nissan NV\n\nBakkie\n\nA generic South African term for light pickup truck.[40]\n\nBaquet\n\nrefers to cars made in the early 1900s in Europe.

Its doors are often longer than those of an equivalent sedan and the rear passenger area smaller; the roof may also be low. In cases where the rear seats are very small and not intended for regular use it is called a 2+2 (pronounced \"two plus two\"). Originally, a coupé was required to have only one side window per side, but this consideration has not been used for many years. Occasionally seen as Fixed Head Coupé, or FHC, particularly when referring to a hardtop version of a convertible.\n\nCombi Coupé\n\nA 2-door, 4-seat car with hatchback door at rear and, collapsible rear seats, resembling a fastback. The idea is to maximize the carrying capacity without bargaining on the performance.\n\nCoupé utility\n\nA passenger-car derived vehicle with an integral exterior cargo area.\n\nCrossover (or CUV) A loose marketing term to describe a vehicle that blends features of a SUV with features of a car - especially forgoing the body on frame construction of the SUV in favor of the car\u0027s unibody or monocoque construction. Crossovers usually borrow drivetrains and other parts from traditional cars in the same manufacturer\u0027s line. Crossovers typically employ an FF layout or an FF-based four-wheel drive layout with a transverse engine, rather than an FR layout or an FR-based 4WD layout with a longitudinal engine as is typically used on traditional truck-based SUVs.\n\nDrop Head Coupé\n\nOften abbreviated to DHC.

For example, by means of the body style and the \"level of commonality in vehicle construction as defined by number of doors and roof treatment (e.g., sedan, convertible, fastback, hatchback) and number of seats\" that require seat belts to meet safety regulations.[1]\n\nRegulatory agencies may also establish a vehicle classification system for determining a tax amount. In the United Kingdom, a vehicle is taxed according to the vehicle\u0027s construction, engine, weight, type of fuel and emissions, as well as the purpose for which it is used.[2] Other jurisdictions may determine vehicle tax based upon environmental principles, such as the user pays principle.[3] In another example, certain cities in the United States in the 1920s chose to exempt electric-powered vehicles because officials believed those vehicles did not cause \"substantial wear upon the pavements\".[4]\n\nAnother standard for road vehicles of all types that is used internationally (except for Australia, India, and the U.S.) is ISO 3833-1977.[5]\n\nIn an example from private enterprise, many car rental companies use the ACRISS Car Classification Code to describe the size, type and equipment of vehicles to ensure that rental agents can match customer needs to available vehicles, regardless of distance between the agent and the rental company or the languages spoken by either party. In the United States, since 2010 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety uses a scheme it has developed that takes into account a combination of both vehicle shadow (length times width) and weight.[6]\n\nUS Highway Loss Data Institute classification Definition\n\nRegular Two Door Two door sedans and hatchbacks\n\nRegular Four Door Four door sedans and hatchbacks\n\nStation Wagons Four doors, a rear hatch and four pillars\n\nMinivans Vans with sliding rear doors\n\nSports Two seaters and cars with significant high performance features\n\nLuxury Relatively expensive cars that are not classified as sports (price in USD to curb weight in pounds more than 9.0 in 2010) (small cars over $27,000, midsize cars over $31,500, large cars over $36,000, etc.)\n\nUS Insurance Institute for Highway Safety | Highway Loss Data Institute \u0027Guide to car size groups\u0027 (includes minivans)[7]\n\nShadow (square footage of exterior length × width)\n\nCurb Weight 70 to 80 sq ft(6.5-7.4 m2) 81 to 90 sq ft (7.5-8.4 m2) 91 to 100 sq ft (8.5-9.3 m2) 101 to 110 sq ft (9.4-10.2 m2) \u003e110 sq ft (10.2 m2)\n\n2,001 to 2,500 lb (900-1,150 kg) Mini Small Small Small Midsize\n\n2,501 to 3,000 lb (1,150-1,350 kg) Small Small Midsize Midsize Midsize\n\n3,001 to 3,500 lb (1,350-1,600 kg) Small Midsize Midsize Large Large\n\n3,501 to 4,000 lb (1,600-1,800 kg) Small Midsize Large Large Very Large\n\n\u003e4,000 lb (1,800 kg) Midsize Midsize Large Very Large Very Large\n\nUS IIHS|HLDI Guide to SUV size groups[8]\n\ncurb weight\n\nMini \u003c\u003d3,000 lb (1,350 kg) and shadow \u003c80 sq ft (7.4 m2)\n\nSmall 3,001 to 3,750 lb (1,350-1,700 kg)\n\nMidsize 3,751 to 4,750 lb (1,700-2,150 kg)\n\nLarge 4,751 to 5,750 lb (2,150-2,600 kg)\n\nVery large \u003e5,750 lb (2,600 kg) or shadow \u003e115 sq ft (10.7 m2)\n\nThe United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) separates vehicles into classes by the curb weight of the vehicle with standard equipment including the maximum capacity of fuel, oil, coolant, and air conditioning, if so equipped.[9]\n\nUS NHTSA classification Code Curb weight\n\nPassenger cars: mini PC/Mi 1,500 to 1,999 lb (700-900 kg)\n\nPassenger cars: light PC/L 2,000 to 2,499 lb (900-1,150 kg)\n\nPassenger cars: compact PC/C 2,500 to 2,999 lb (1,150-1,350 kg)\n\nPassenger cars: medium PC/Me 3,000 to 3,499 lb (1,350-1,600 kg)\n\nPassenger cars: heavy PC/H 3,500 lb (1,600 kg) and over\n\nSport utility vehicles SUV -\n\nPickup trucks PU -\n\nVans VAN -\n\nThe United States Federal Highway Administration has developed a classification scheme used for automatically calculating road use tolls. There are two broad categories depending on whether the vehicle carries passengers or commodities. Vehicles that carry commodities are further subdivided by number of axles and number of units, including both power and trailer units.[10]\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has developed a classification scheme used to compare fuel economy among similar vehicles. Passenger vehicles are classified based on a vehicle\u0027s total interior passenger and cargo volumes. Trucks are classified based upon their gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). Heavy duty vehicles are not included within the EPA scheme.[11]\n\nUS EPA car class Total passenger and cargo volume (cu. ft.)\n\nTwo-seaters Any (designed to seat only two adults) Less than 85 cu ft (2,400 l) 85 to 99 cu ft (2,400-2,800 l) 100 to 109 cu ft (2,850-3,100 l) 110 to 119 cu ft (3,100-3,350 l) 120 cu ft (3,400 l) or more Less than 130 cu ft (3,700 l) 130 to 159 cu ft (3,700-4,500 l)\n\nMinicompact\n\nSubcompact\n\nCompact\n\nMid-size\n\nLarge\n\nMid-size station wagons\n\nLarge station wagons 160 cu ft (4,550 l) or more\n\nSmall station wagons\n\nA similar set of classes is used by the Canadian EPA.[12] The Canadian National Collision Database (NCDB) system defines \"passenger car\" as a unique class, but also identifies two other categories involving passenger vehicles-the \"passenger van\" and \"light utility vehicle\"-and these categories are inconsistently handled across the country with the boundaries between the vehicles increasingly blurred.[13]\n\nIn Australia, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries publishes its own classifications.[14]\n\nThis is a summary table listing several diferent methods of vehicle classification.\n\nSize and usage-based vehicle classification systems worldwide\n\nNot well-defined / vernacular Defined by law or regulation\n\nExamples Market segment (American English)\n\nMarket segment (British English)\n\nMarket segment (Australian English)[15]\n\nUS EPA Size Class [16]\n\nEuro NCAP Structural Category [17]\n\nEuro NCAP Class (1997- 2009)\n\nEuro Market Segment [18]\n\nMicrocar Microcar,Bubble car N/A N/A -

Some microcars are three-wheelers, while the majority have four wheels. Microcars were popular in post-war Europe, where their appearance led them to be called \"Bubble cars\". More recent microcars are often electric powered.\n\nExamples of microcars:\n\nIsetta Smart Fortwo Tata Nano\n\nIn 2012, Japan\u0027s Transport and Tourism Ministry allowed local government to use ultracompact cars as transport for residents and tourists in their limiting areas. The size of ultracompact cars will be less than minicars, but have engine greater than 50cc displacement and able to transport 1 or 2 persons. Ultracompact cars cannot use minicars standard, because of strict safety standards for minicars. The regulation about running capacity and safety performance of ultracompact cars will be published in early autumn. Today, there are cars smaller than ultracompact cars, called category-1 motorized vehicles which it has 50cc displacement or less and only one seat for the driver.[19]\n\nA city car is a small automobile intended for use in urban areas. Unlike microcars, a city car\u0027s greater speed, capacity and (in perception at least) occupant protection are safer in mixed traffic environments and weather conditions. While city cars can reach highway speeds, that is not their intended use. In Japan, city cars are called kei cars.[20] Kei cars have to meet strict size and engine requirements: engines have a maximum displacement of 660 cc and the car\u0027s length must be under 3400 mm.\n\nExamples of kei cars:\n\nDaihatsu Move\n\nEconomy car\n\nMicrocar\n\nMicrocar Abaca\n\nHatchbacks\n\nUltracompact car\n\nCity car\n\nCitroën C1\n\nHonda Life\n\nSuzuki Cervo Examples of city cars:\n\nFiat Panda Maruti 800\n\nMini (Original 1959 model) Other small cars:\n\nCarver One Citroën Type C Smith Flyer\n\nThis class is known as supermini in the UK, subcompact in North America. Superminis have three, four or five doors, and even as an estate shape. They are designed to seat four passengers comfortably. Current supermini hatchbacks are approximately 3900 mm long, while saloons and estate cars are around 4200 mm long. Currently (2013) sedan variants are generally not available in Europe and are marketed at a lower price than hatchback models in North America.\n\nIn Europe, the first superminis were the Fiat 500 of 1957 and the Austin Mini of 1959. Superminis can be premium cars, such as the Citroën DS3, named 2010 Car of the Year by\n\nTop Gear Magazine. Superminis are some of the best selling vehicles in Europe with 25% of the market shares (2013). In 2007, the Peugeot 207 has been the most sold car in Europe, whereas the best seller is almost systematically a car from the compact segment.\n\nIn Australia, the motoring press tends to distinguish between a light car such as the Daihatsu Charade or early models of the Holden Barina, and slightly larger models such as the Ford Fiesta which is considered to be a small car. As the general size of vehicles in this class has gradually increased, the category of light car has almost disappeared.\n\nExamples of superminis/subcompact cars:\n\nOpel Corsa Peugeot 208 Volkswagen Polo\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Superminis\".\n\nSmall family/compact cars refer to the hatchbacks and shortest saloons and estate cars with similar size. They are approximately 4,250 mm (167 in) long in case of hatchbacks and 4,500 mm (177 in) in the case of saloons and estate cars. Compact cars have room for five adults and usually have engines between 1.4 and 2.2 litres, but some have engines of up to 2.5 litres.\n\nExamples of hatchback small family cars/compact cars:\n\nPeugeot 308 Toyota Auris Renault Megane\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Small Family Cars\". In Australia, this class is generally referred to as being small-medium sized cars.\n\nSupermini/subcompact car\n\nRenault Clio IV\n\nFamily car\n\nSmall family car/compact car\n\nVolkswagen Golf\n\nTraditionally, mid-size cars are sedans, but recently cars such as the Citroën DS5, which is a large hatchback family car, have introduced other body styles.[21]\n\nA class described as \"large family\" in Europe and \"mid-size\" in the USA, these cars have room for five adults and a large trunk (boot). Engines are more powerful than small family/compact cars and six-cylinder engines are more common than in smaller cars. Car sizes vary from region to region; in Europe, large family cars are rarely over 4,700 mm (15.4 ft) long, while in North America, Middle East and Australasia they may be well over 4,800 mm (15.7 ft).\n\nExamples of large family cars/mid-size cars:\n\nChevrolet Malibu Ford Mondeo Kia Optima\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Large Family Cars\". These are known in Australia as Medium sized cars.\n\nThis term is used most in North America, Middle East and Australia where it refers to the largest affordable sedans on the market. Full-size cars may be well over 4,900 mm (16.1 ft) long.\n\nExamples of full-size cars:\n\nDodge Charger Ford Falcon Toyota Avalon [22]\n\nCrossover SUVs are derived from an automobile platform using a monocoque construction with light off-road capability and lower ground clearance than SUVs. They may be styled similar to conventional \"off-roaders\", or may be look similar to an estate car or station wagon.\n\nExamples of crossover SUVs:\n\nChevrolet Equinox Nissan Qashqai Tata Aria\n\nLarge family / mid-size\n\nCitroën DS5\n\nSaloons / sedans\n\nLarge family / mid-size\n\nToyota Camry\n\nFull size / large\n\nHolden Commodore\n\nCrossover SUV\n\nMitsubishi Outlander\n\nAlso known as \"people carriers\", this class of cars resembles tall estate cars. Larger MPVs may have seating for up to eight passengers. (Beyond that size, similar vehicles tend to be derived from vans (see below) and in Europe are called minibuses.)\n\nBeing taller than a family car improves visibility for the driver (while reducing visibility for other road users) and may help access for the elderly or disabled. They also offer more seats and increased load capacity than hatchbacks or estate cars.\n\nExamples of mini MPVs:\n\nCitroën C3 Picasso Ford B-Max Nissan Note Examples of compact MPVs:\n\nOpel Zafira Tourer Peugeot 5008 Renault Scénic\n\nBoth categories are equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Small MPVs\".\n\nExamples of large MPVs / minivans:\n\nDodge Caravan Ford S-Max Mazda5\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"MPVs\".\n\nThese are luxurious equivalents to mid-size and compact cars. Rear seat room and trunk space are smaller than executive cars simply because of their smaller overall size.\n\nExamples of compact premium cars/entry-level luxury cars:\n\nAudi A4 BMW 3 Series Buick Regal\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Large Family Cars\".\n\nThese are luxurious equivalents to full-size cars. This also refers to the largest hatchbacks within the similar length in this class, such as the Porsche Panamera.\n\nExamples of executive cars/mid-luxury cars:\n\nPeugeot 607 Jaguar XF MG Magnette\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Executive Cars\".\n\nMinivans / MPVs\n\nRenault Espace, one of the first true minivans\n\nFord C-Max, a compact MPV\n\nOpel Meriva a mini MPV\n\nLuxury vehicle\n\nCompact executive\n\nLexus IS\n\nExecutive/mid-luxury\n\nBMW 5 Series\n\nFull-size luxury / Grand saloon\n\nAlso known as full-size luxury cars, grand saloons, or premium large cars, while\n\n\"Oberklasse\" is used in Germany. Typically a four-door saloon (sedan). These are the most powerful saloons, with six, eight and twelve-cylinder engines and have more equipment than smaller models. Vehicles in this category include some of the models from the flagship lines of luxury car brands, such as Cadillac CT6,[23] Lincoln Town Car and Maserati Quattroporte.\n\nExamples of grand saloons:\n\nAudi A8 Lexus LS BMW 7 Series\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Executive Cars\".\n\nA station wagon (also known as an estate or estate car) is an automobile with a body style variant of a sedan/saloon with its roof extended rearward over a shared passenger/cargo volume with access at the back via a third or fifth door (the liftgate or tailgate), instead of a trunk lid. The body style transforms a standard three-box design into a two-box design-to include an A, B, and C-pillar, as well as a D-pillar. Station wagons can flexibly reconfigure their interior volume via fold-down rear seats to prioritize either passenger or cargo volume.\n\nExamples of estates/station wagons:\n\nHyundai i40 Tourer Jaguar XF Sportbrake Mercedes-Benz CLS Shooting Brake\n\nA hot hatch is a high-performance hatchback, based on standard superminis or small family cars with improved performance, handling and styling. Hot hatches are very popular in Europe, where hatchbacks are by far the most common body style for this size of car. In North America, sport compacts are usually sold as saloons or coupés rather than hatchbacks.\n\nExamples of hot hatches:\n\nVolkswagen Golf GTi Peugeot 205 GTi Fiat 500 Abarth\n\nThese are high-performance versions of saloons. Sometimes originally homologated for production based motorsports (touring cars or rally cars) and like regular saloons, seats four or five people.\n\nExamples of sports saloons/sedans:\n\nBMW M5 Mazdaspeed6/Mazda 6 MPS Dodge Charger Examples of sport compact saloons/sedans:\n\nMercedes-Benz S-Class\n\nEstate cars / station wagons\n\nAudi A6 avant\n\nSports cars\n\nHot hatch\n\nPeugeot 205 GTI crowned \"The Greatest Ever Hot Hatch\"[24]\n\nSports saloon / sports sedan\n\nPontiac G8 GT\n\nDodge SRT-4\n\nLotus Cortina\n\nMitsubishi EVO\n\nThe term \"sports car\" does not appear to have a clear definition.[25] It is commonly used to describe vehicles which prioritise acceleration and handling; however, some people claim it is also defined as a vehicle with two seats.[26]\n\nA Sports car (sportscar or sport car) is a small, usually two-seat, two-door automobile designed for spirited performance and nimble handling.[27] Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious but high maneuverability and minimum weight are requisite.[28]\n\nExamples of sports cars:\n\nChevrolet Corvette Mazda MX-5 Porsche 911\n\nLarger, more powerful and heavier than sports cars, these vehicles typically have a FR layout and seating for four passengers (2+2). These are more expensive than sports cars but not as expensive as supercars. Grand Tourers encompass both luxury and high-performance. Some grand tourers are hand-built.\n\nExamples of grand tourers:\n\nAston Martin V8 Lexus SC300/400 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti\n\nSupercar is a term generally used for ultra-high-end exotic cars, whose performance is superior to that of its contemporaries. The proper application of the term is subjective and disputed, especially among enthusiasts.\n\nExamples of supercars:\n\nMcLaren P1 Koenigsegg Agera R Bugatti Veyron 16.4\n\nThe muscle car term generally refers to rear wheel drive mid-size cars with powerful V8 engines, typically manufactured in the U.S.[29][30] Some definitions limit it to two-door vehicles;[31] however, others include four-door body style versions.[32] Although opinions vary, it is generally accepted that classic muscle cars were produced in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[33][34][35][36] Muscle cars were also produced in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and other nations.\n\nExamples of American muscle cars from the 1960s and 1970s:\n\nFord Torino Plymouth Road Runner\n\nSports car\n\nJaguar E-Type\n\nGrand tourer\n\nMaserati GranTurismo\n\nSupercar\n\nLamborghini Countach\n\nMuscle car\n\n1970 AMC The Machine\n\nPontiac GTO Examples of Australian muscle cars:\n\nFord Falcon Holden Monaro Valiant Charger\n\nThe pony car is a class of American Muscle car[37] automobile launched and inspired by the Ford Mustang in 1964. It describes an affordable, compact, highly styled car with a sporty or performance-oriented image.[38][39]\n\nExamples of pony cars:\n\nAMC Javelin Chevrolet Camaro Dodge Challenger\n\nA body design that features a flexibly operating roof for open or enclosed mode driving. Also known as a cabriolet or roadster (if a 2-seater). Historically, convertibles used folding roof structures with fabric or other flexible materials. Some designs have roofs made of metal or other stiff materials that retract into the body.\n\nExamples of cabriolets:\n\nMazda MX-5 Honda S2000 Volvo C70\n\nOff-road vehicles, or \"off-roaders\" are sometimes referred to as \"four-wheel drives\", \"four by fours\", or 4x4s - this can happen colloquially in cases where certain models or even an entire range does not possess four-wheel drive.\n\nSport utility vehicles are off-road vehicles with four-wheel drive and true off-road capability. They most often feature high ground clearance and an upright, boxy body design. Sport Utilities are typically defined by a body on frame construction which offers more off-road capability but reduced on-road ride comfort and handling compared to a cross-over or car based utility vehicle.\n\nExamples of compact SUVs:\n\nLand Rover Freelander Jeep Patriot\n\nToyota FJ Cruiser\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Small Off-Roaders\".\n\nPony car\n\n1966 Ford Mustang\n\nConvertible\n\nFull-sized convertible with its fabric covered top folded behind the rear seat\n\nOff-roaders\n\nSport utility vehicle\n\nJeep Commander\n\nExamples of SUVs:\n\nLand Rover Discovery Mitsubishi Pajero Mahindra Scorpio\n\nThis category is equivalent to the EuroNCAP class \"Large Off-Roaders\".\n\nIn some countries, the term \"van\" can refer to a small panel van based on a passenger car design (often the estate model / station wagon); it also refers to light trucks, which themselves are sometimes based on SUVs or MPVs. (But note that those retaining seats and windows, while being larger and more utilitarian than MPVs, may be called \"minibuses\".) The term is also used in the term \"camper van\" (or just \"camper\") - equivalent to a North American recreational vehicle (RV).\n\nIn the United States, the term \"van\" refers to vehicles that, like European minibuses, are even larger than large MPVs and are rarely seen being driven for domestic purposes - except for \"conversion vans\". These possess extremely large interior space and are often more intended for hauling cargo than people. Most vans use body-on-frame construction and are thus suitable for extensive modification and coachwork, known as conversion. Conversion vans are often quite luxurious, boasting comfortable seats, soft rides, built-in support for electronics such as television sets, and other amenities. The more elaborate conversion vans straddle the line between cars and recreational vehicles.\n\nExamples of North American \"vans\":\n\nDodge Ram Van Ford E-Series GMC Savana Examples of European \"vans\":\n\nFord Transit Volkswagen Transporter Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Examples of Japanese \"vans\"\n\nToyota Hiace Nissan NV\n\nBakkie\n\nA generic South African term for light pickup truck.[40]\n\nBaquet\n\nrefers to cars made in the early 1900s in Europe.

Its doors are often longer than those of an equivalent sedan and the rear passenger area smaller; the roof may also be low. In cases where the rear seats are very small and not intended for regular use it is called a 2+2 (pronounced \"two plus two\"). Originally, a coupé was required to have only one side window per side, but this consideration has not been used for many years. Occasionally seen as Fixed Head Coupé, or FHC, particularly when referring to a hardtop version of a convertible.\n\nCombi Coupé\n\nA 2-door, 4-seat car with hatchback door at rear and, collapsible rear seats, resembling a fastback. The idea is to maximize the carrying capacity without bargaining on the performance.\n\nCoupé utility\n\nA passenger-car derived vehicle with an integral exterior cargo area.\n\nCrossover (or CUV) A loose marketing term to describe a vehicle that blends features of a SUV with features of a car - especially forgoing the body on frame construction of the SUV in favor of the car\u0027s unibody or monocoque construction. Crossovers usually borrow drivetrains and other parts from traditional cars in the same manufacturer\u0027s line. Crossovers typically employ an FF layout or an FF-based four-wheel drive layout with a transverse engine, rather than an FR layout or an FR-based 4WD layout with a longitudinal engine as is typically used on traditional truck-based SUVs.\n\nDrop Head Coupé\n\nOften abbreviated to DHC.

title\n\nCar seat\n\nA car seat is the seat used in automobiles. Most car seats are made from inexpensive but durable material in order to withstand prolonged use. The most common material is polyester.\n\n1 Bucket seat and bench seat 2 Folding seats\n\n3 Ergonomy: lumbar and thigh support\n\n4 Safety\n\n5 Power seats\n\n6 Covers\n\n7 Seat construction\n\n7.1 Parts 7.2 Adjustments\n\n8 Climate control and ventilation 9 See also 10 References\n\nA bucket seat is a separate seat with a contoured platform designed to accommodate one person, distinct from a bench seat that is a flat platform designed to seat up to three people. Individual bucket seats typically have rounded backs and may offer a variety of adjustments to fit diferent passengers.\n\nEarly touring cars featured folding auxiliary seats to offer additional passenger capacity.[1] Some early automobiles were available with an exterior rumble seat that folded open into an upholstered seat for one or two passengers.\n\nSome sedan models offer fold-down rear seats (e.g. Chevrolet Corvair), to gain cargo space when they are not occupied by passengers.\n\nA fold-down front-passenger seat was a feature on the Chrysler PT Cruiser to fit longer items such as a 8-foot (2.4 m) ladder inside the vehicle.[2]\n\nThe lumbar is the region of the spine between the diaphragm and the pelvis; it supports the most weight and is the most flexible. The adjustable lumbar mechanisms in seats allow the user to change the seat back shape in this region, to make it more comfortable and include adjustable lumbar cushion. Some seats are long enough to support full thigh and follow back curves.\n\nFront bucket seats in a BMW Alpina\n\nContents\n\nBucket seat and bench seat\n\nRear bench seat for three adult passengers in a AMC Ambassador\n\nFolding seats\n\nErgonomy: lumbar and thigh support\n\nThe National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act enacted by the U.S. in 1966 established standards of strength for automobile seats. These included requirements for proper anchorage and construction of automobile vehicle seat assemblies.[3] The legal requirements in some jurisdictions for a child to sit up front is 5\u00270 and they must weigh more than 80 lbs. Some studies have shown that drivers have an aversion towards carrying the full capacity amount of passengers due to concerns over insufficient vision through the back window.[4]\n\nAn anti-submarine seat is a kind of seat that incorporates specially shaped panels in the forward edge of the seat cushion, reducing the tendency for the occupant to slide beneath the seatbelt in a severe frontal collision. Anti-submarine seating is a safety feature that may be more important for the front seats than the rear seats.[5]\n\nA child safety seat or child restraint system is a restraint which is secured to the seat of an automobile equipped with safety harnesses or seat belts, to hold a child in the event of a crash. All 50 states require child seats with specific criteria. Requirements vary based on a child\u0027s age, weight and height. The National Child Passenger Safety Board, managed by the National Safety Council, maintains the quality and integrity of the National Child Passenger Safety Certification Training Program. The program is used to train and certify child passenger safety technicians and instructors in order to assist caregivers in safe transportation of children.[6]\n\nSide airbags are often built right into the side of the seat. Seats so equipped should not be covered which impedes the operation of the airbag.[7]\n\nSome car seat systems are set up with a battery-powered automatic control to adjust how the seat sits in the car.\n\nIn suitably equipped cars, seats and mirrors can be adjusted using electric controls. Some vehicles let the driver(s) save the adjustments in memory (memory seat) for later recall, with the push of a button. Most systems allow users to store more than one set of adjustments. This allows multiple drivers to store their comfort settings, or a single driver to store several different occupant positions. Some vehicles associate memorized settings with a specifically numbered, remotely operated key fob, resetting a seat to the position associated with that fob when the vehicle is unlocked (e.g. key fob #1 sets seats to memory position #1, #2 to #2, etc.).\n\nCar seat covers are accessories that protect the original seat upholstery from wear and add a custom look to a vehicle\u0027s interior. They can help to maintain the resale value of the vehicle and maximize the comfort of the driver and passengers.\n\nArmrest Backrest, with lumbar support Headrest\n\nSeat base Seat track\n\nAuxiliary folding seat in a 1921 Hudson Phaeton\n\nSafety\n\nPower seats\n\nThe power seat adjustments in a Lincoln Town Car.

Ventilation was introduced in 1997 by Saab and heating by Cadillac in 1966.\n\n1. \"Recent Developments in Body Design\" (https://books.google.com/books?id\u003d02gfAQAAMAAJ\u0026pg\u003dPA261\u0026lpg\u003dPA2 61\u0026dq\u003dfolding+auxiliary+seats+touring+cars).

Most car seats are made from inexpensive but durable material in order to withstand prolonged use. The most common material is polyester.\n\n1 Bucket seat and bench seat 2 Folding seats\n\n3 Ergonomy: lumbar and thigh support\n\n4 Safety\n\n5 Power seats\n\n6 Covers\n\n7 Seat construction\n\n7.1 Parts 7.2 Adjustments\n\n8 Climate control and ventilation 9 See also 10 References\n\nA bucket seat is a separate seat with a contoured platform designed to accommodate one person, distinct from a bench seat that is a flat platform designed to seat up to three people. Individual bucket seats typically have rounded backs and may offer a variety of adjustments to fit diferent passengers.\n\nEarly touring cars featured folding auxiliary seats to offer additional passenger capacity.[1] Some early automobiles were available with an exterior rumble seat that folded open into an upholstered seat for one or two passengers.\n\nSome sedan models offer fold-down rear seats (e.g. Chevrolet Corvair), to gain cargo space when they are not occupied by passengers.\n\nA fold-down front-passenger seat was a feature on the Chrysler PT Cruiser to fit longer items such as a 8-foot (2.4 m) ladder inside the vehicle.[2]\n\nThe lumbar is the region of the spine between the diaphragm and the pelvis; it supports the most weight and is the most flexible. The adjustable lumbar mechanisms in seats allow the user to change the seat back shape in this region, to make it more comfortable and include adjustable lumbar cushion. Some seats are long enough to support full thigh and follow back curves.\n\nFront bucket seats in a BMW Alpina\n\nContents\n\nBucket seat and bench seat\n\nRear bench seat for three adult passengers in a AMC Ambassador\n\nFolding seats\n\nErgonomy: lumbar and thigh support\n\nThe National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act enacted by the U.S. in 1966 established standards of strength for automobile seats. These included requirements for proper anchorage and construction of automobile vehicle seat assemblies.[3] The legal requirements in some jurisdictions for a child to sit up front is 5\u00270 and they must weigh more than 80 lbs. Some studies have shown that drivers have an aversion towards carrying the full capacity amount of passengers due to concerns over insufficient vision through the back window.[4]\n\nAn anti-submarine seat is a kind of seat that incorporates specially shaped panels in the forward edge of the seat cushion, reducing the tendency for the occupant to slide beneath the seatbelt in a severe frontal collision. Anti-submarine seating is a safety feature that may be more important for the front seats than the rear seats.[5]\n\nA child safety seat or child restraint system is a restraint which is secured to the seat of an automobile equipped with safety harnesses or seat belts, to hold a child in the event of a crash. All 50 states require child seats with specific criteria. Requirements vary based on a child\u0027s age, weight and height. The National Child Passenger Safety Board, managed by the National Safety Council, maintains the quality and integrity of the National Child Passenger Safety Certification Training Program. The program is used to train and certify child passenger safety technicians and instructors in order to assist caregivers in safe transportation of children.[6]\n\nSide airbags are often built right into the side of the seat. Seats so equipped should not be covered which impedes the operation of the airbag.[7]\n\nSome car seat systems are set up with a battery-powered automatic control to adjust how the seat sits in the car.\n\nIn suitably equipped cars, seats and mirrors can be adjusted using electric controls. Some vehicles let the driver(s) save the adjustments in memory (memory seat) for later recall, with the push of a button. Most systems allow users to store more than one set of adjustments. This allows multiple drivers to store their comfort settings, or a single driver to store several different occupant positions. Some vehicles associate memorized settings with a specifically numbered, remotely operated key fob, resetting a seat to the position associated with that fob when the vehicle is unlocked (e.g. key fob #1 sets seats to memory position #1, #2 to #2, etc.).\n\nCar seat covers are accessories that protect the original seat upholstery from wear and add a custom look to a vehicle\u0027s interior. They can help to maintain the resale value of the vehicle and maximize the comfort of the driver and passengers.\n\nArmrest Backrest, with lumbar support Headrest\n\nSeat base Seat track\n\nAuxiliary folding seat in a 1921 Hudson Phaeton\n\nSafety\n\nPower seats\n\nThe power seat adjustments in a Lincoln Town Car.

Ventilation was introduced in 1997 by Saab and heating by Cadillac in 1966.\n\n1. \"Recent Developments in Body Design\" (https://books.google.com/books?id\u003d02gfAQAAMAAJ\u0026pg\u003dPA261\u0026lpg\u003dPA2 61\u0026dq\u003dfolding+auxiliary+seats+touring+cars).

vehicles. Its main goals are reducing drag and wind noise, minimizing noise emission, and preventing undesired lift forces and other causes of aerodynamic instability at high speeds. Air is also considered a fluid in this case. For some classes of racing vehicles, it may also be important to produce downforce to improve traction and thus cornering abilities.\n\n1 History\n\n2 Features of Aerodynamic Vehicles\n\n3 Comparison with Aircraft Aerodynamics\n\n4 Methods of Studying Aerodynamics\n\n5 Drag coefficient\n\n6 Downforce\n\n7 See also\n\n8 References\n\n9 External links\n\nThe frictional force of aerodynamic drag increases significantly with vehicle speed.[1] As early as the 1920s engineers began to consider automobile shape in reducing aerodynamic drag at higher speeds. By the 1950s German and British automotive engineers were systematically analyzing the effects of automotive drag for the higher performance vehicles.[2] By the late 1960s scientists also became aware of the significant increase in sound levels emitted by automobiles at high speed. These effects were understood to increase the intensity of sound levels for adjacent land uses at a non-linear rate.[3] Soon highway engineers began to design roadways to consider the speed effects of aerodynamic drag produced sound levels, and automobile manufacturers considered the same factors in vehicle design.\n\nAn aerodynamic automobile will integrate the wheel arcs and lights into the overall shape to reduce drag. It will be streamlined; for example, it does not have sharp edges crossing the wind stream above the windshield and will feature a sort of tail called a fastback or Kammback or liftback. Note that the Aptera 2e, the Loremo, and the Volkswagen 1-litre car try to reduce the area of their back. It will have a flat and smooth floor to support the Venturi effect and produce desirable downwards aerodynamic forces. The air that rams into the engine bay, is used for cooling, combustion, and for passengers, then reaccelerated by a nozzle and then ejected under the floor. For mid and rear engines air is decelerated and pressurized in a diffuser, loses some pressure as it passes the engine bay, and fills the slipstream. These cars need a seal between the low pressure region around the wheels and the high pressure around the gearbox. They all have a closed engine bay floor. The suspension is either streamlined (Aptera) or retracted.

The side mirror can only have a round fairing as a nose. Air flow through the wheel-bays is said to increase drag (German source) though race cars need it for brake cooling and many cars emit the air from the radiator into the wheel bay.\n\nAutomotive aerodynamics differs from aircraft aerodynamics in several ways. First, the characteristic shape of a road vehicle is much less streamlined compared to an aircraft. Second, the vehicle operates very close to the ground, rather than in free air. Third, the operating speeds are lower (and aerodynamic drag varies as the square of speed). Fourth, a ground vehicle has fewer degrees of freedom than an aircraft, and its motion is less affected by aerodynamic forces. Fifth, passenger and commercial ground vehicles have very specific design constraints such as their intended purpose, high safety standards (requiring, for example, more \u0027dead\u0027 structural space to act as crumple zones), and certain regulations.\n\nAutomotive aerodynamics is studied using both computer modelling and wind tunnel testing. For the most accurate results from a wind tunnel test, the tunnel is sometimes equipped with a rolling road. This is a movable floor for the working section, which moves at the same speed as the air flow. This prevents a boundary layer from forming on the floor of the working section and affecting the results. An example of such a rolling road wind tunnel is Wind Shear\u0027s Full Scale, Rolling Road, Automotive Wind Tunnel in Concord, North Carolina and Auto Research Center in Indianapolis, Indiana USA.\n\nDrag coefficient (Cd) is a commonly published rating of a car\u0027s aerodynamic smoothness, related to the shape of the car. Multiplying Cd by the car\u0027s frontal area gives an index of total drag. The result is called drag area, and is listed below for several cars. The width and height of curvy cars lead to gross overestimation of frontal area. These numbers use the manufacturer\u0027s frontal area specifications from the Mayfield Company unless noted.[4]\n\nSome examples:\n\nComparison with Aircraft Aerodynamics\n\nMethods of Studying Aerodynamics\n\nOne of the side efects of automotive aerodynamics is seed dispersal.\n\nPlay media\n\nDrag coefficient\n\nDrag area ( C d x Ft2) Year Automobile\n\n3.0 sq ft\n\n(0.28 m2) 2012 Volkswagen XL1\n\n[5]\n\n3.95 1996 GM EV1\n\n5.10 1999 Honda Insight\n\n5.40 1989 Opel Calibra\n\n5.54 1980 Ferrari 308 GTB\n\n5.61 1993 Mazda RX-7\n\n5.61 1993 McLaren F1\n\n5.63 1991 Opel Calibra\n\n5.64 1990 Bugatti EB110\n\n5.71 1990 Honda CR-X\n\n5.74 2002 Acura NSX\n\n5.76 1968 Toyota 2000GT\n\n5.88 1990 Nissan 240SX\n\n5.86 2001 Audi A2 1.2 TDI 3L\n\n5.91 1986 Citroën AX\n\n5.92 1994 Porsche 911Speedster\n\n5.95 1994 McLaren F1\n\n6.00 2011 LamborghiniAventador S\n\n6.00 1992 Subaru SVX\n\n6.06 2003 Opel Astra CoupeTurbo\n\n6.08 2008 Nissan GT-R\n\n6.13 1991 Acura NSX\n\n6.15 1989 Suzuki Swift GT\n\n6.17 1995 Lamborghini Diablo\n\n6.19 1969 Porsche 914\n\n6.2 2012 Tesla Model S\n\n6.24 2004 Toyota Prius\n\n6.27 1986 Porsche 911Carrera\n\n6.27 1992 Chevrolet Corvette\n\n6.35 1999 Lotus Elise\n\n6.77 1995 BMW M3\n\n6.79 1993 Corolla DX\n\n6.81 1989 Subaru Legacy\n\n6.96 1988 Porsche 944 S\n\n7.02 1992 BMW 325 I\n\n7.10 1978 Saab 900\n\n7.13 2007 SSC Ultimate Aero\n\n7.31 2015 Mazda3\n\n7.48 1993 Chevrolet CamaroZ28\n\n7.57 1992 Toyota Camry\n\n8.70 1990 Volvo 740 Turbo\n\n8.71 1991 Buick LeSabreLimited\n\n9.54 1992 Chevrolet CapriceWagon\n\n10.7 1992 Chevrolet S-10Blazer\n\n11.63 1991 Jeep Cherokee\n\n13.10 1990 Range RoverClassic\n\n13.76 1994 Toyota T100 SR54x4\n\n14.52 1994 Toyota LandCruiser\n\n17.43 1992 Land RoverDiscovery\n\n18.03 1992 Land RoverDefender 90\n\n18.06 1993 Hummer H1\n\n20.24 1993 Land RoverDefender 110\n\n26.32 2006 Hummer H2\n\nDownforce describes the downward pressure created by the aerodynamic characteristics of a car that allows it to travel faster through a corner by holding the car to the track or road surface. Some elements to increase vehicle downforce will also increase drag. It is very important to produce a good downward aerodynamic force because it affects the car\u0027s speed and traction.[6]\n\nDownforce\n\n1.

By the 1950s German and British automotive engineers were systematically analyzing the effects of automotive drag for the higher performance vehicles.[2] By the late 1960s scientists also became aware of the significant increase in sound levels emitted by automobiles at high speed. These effects were understood to increase the intensity of sound levels for adjacent land uses at a non-linear rate.[3] Soon highway engineers began to design roadways to consider the speed effects of aerodynamic drag produced sound levels, and automobile manufacturers considered the same factors in vehicle design.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn aerodynamic automobile will integrate the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel\"\u003ewhee\u003c/a\u003el arcs and lights into the overall shape to reduce drag.

Its main goals are reducing drag and wind noise, minimizing noise emission, and preventing undesired lift forces and other causes of aerodynamic instability at high speeds. Air is also considered a fluid in this case. For some classes of racing vehicles, it may also be important to produce downforce to improve traction and thus cornering abilities.\n\n1 History\n\n2 Features of Aerodynamic Vehicles\n\n3 Comparison with Aircraft Aerodynamics\n\n4 Methods of Studying Aerodynamics\n\n5 Drag coefficient\n\n6 Downforce\n\n7 See also\n\n8 References\n\n9 External links\n\nThe frictional force of aerodynamic drag increases significantly with vehicle speed.[1] As early as the 1920s engineers began to consider automobile shape in reducing aerodynamic drag at higher speeds. By the 1950s German and British automotive engineers were systematically analyzing the effects of automotive drag for the higher performance vehicles.[2] By the late 1960s scientists also became aware of the significant increase in sound levels emitted by automobiles at high speed. These effects were understood to increase the intensity of sound levels for adjacent land uses at a non-linear rate.[3] Soon highway engineers began to design roadways to consider the speed effects of aerodynamic drag produced sound levels, and automobile manufacturers considered the same factors in vehicle design.\n\nAn aerodynamic automobile will integrate the wheel arcs and lights into the overall shape to reduce drag. It will be streamlined; for example, it does not have sharp edges crossing the wind stream above the windshield and will feature a sort of tail called a fastback or Kammback or liftback. Note that the Aptera 2e, the Loremo, and the Volkswagen 1-litre car try to reduce the area of their back. It will have a flat and smooth floor to support the Venturi effect and produce desirable downwards aerodynamic forces. The air that rams into the engine bay, is used for cooling, combustion, and for passengers, then reaccelerated by a nozzle and then ejected under the floor. For mid and rear engines air is decelerated and pressurized in a diffuser, loses some pressure as it passes the engine bay, and fills the slipstream. These cars need a seal between the low pressure region around the wheels and the high pressure around the gearbox. They all have a closed engine bay floor. The suspension is either streamlined (Aptera) or retracted. Door handles, the\n\nA truck with added bodywork on top of the cab to reduce drag.\n\nContents\n\nHistory\n\nFeatures of Aerodynamic Vehicles\n\nantenna, and roof rails can have a streamlined shape. The side mirror can only have a round fairing as a nose. Air flow through the wheel-bays is said to increase drag (German source) though race cars need it for brake cooling and many cars emit the air from the radiator into the wheel bay.\n\nAutomotive aerodynamics differs from aircraft aerodynamics in several ways. First, the characteristic shape of a road vehicle is much less streamlined compared to an aircraft. Second, the vehicle operates very close to the ground, rather than in free air. Third, the operating speeds are lower (and aerodynamic drag varies as the square of speed). Fourth, a ground vehicle has fewer degrees of freedom than an aircraft, and its motion is less affected by aerodynamic forces. Fifth, passenger and commercial ground vehicles have very specific design constraints such as their intended purpose, high safety standards (requiring, for example, more \u0027dead\u0027 structural space to act as crumple zones), and certain regulations.\n\nAutomotive aerodynamics is studied using both computer modelling and wind tunnel testing. For the most accurate results from a wind tunnel test, the tunnel is sometimes equipped with a rolling road. This is a movable floor for the working section, which moves at the same speed as the air flow. This prevents a boundary layer from forming on the floor of the working section and affecting the results. An example of such a rolling road wind tunnel is Wind Shear\u0027s Full Scale, Rolling Road, Automotive Wind Tunnel in Concord, North Carolina and Auto Research Center in Indianapolis, Indiana USA.\n\nDrag coefficient (Cd) is a commonly published rating of a car\u0027s aerodynamic smoothness, related to the shape of the car. Multiplying Cd by the car\u0027s frontal area gives an index of total drag. The result is called drag area, and is listed below for several cars. The width and height of curvy cars lead to gross overestimation of frontal area. These numbers use the manufacturer\u0027s frontal area specifications from the Mayfield Company unless noted.[4]\n\nSome examples:\n\nComparison with Aircraft Aerodynamics\n\nMethods of Studying Aerodynamics\n\nOne of the side efects of automotive aerodynamics is seed dispersal.\n\nPlay media\n\nDrag coefficient\n\nDrag area ( C d x Ft2) Year Automobile\n\n3.0 sq ft\n\n(0.28 m2) 2012 Volkswagen XL1\n\n[5]\n\n3.95 1996 GM EV1\n\n5.10 1999 Honda Insight\n\n5.40 1989 Opel Calibra\n\n5.54 1980 Ferrari 308 GTB\n\n5.61 1993 Mazda RX-7\n\n5.61 1993 McLaren F1\n\n5.63 1991 Opel Calibra\n\n5.64 1990 Bugatti EB110\n\n5.71 1990 Honda CR-X\n\n5.74 2002 Acura NSX\n\n5.76 1968 Toyota 2000GT\n\n5.88 1990 Nissan 240SX\n\n5.86 2001 Audi A2 1.2 TDI 3L\n\n5.91 1986 Citroën AX\n\n5.92 1994 Porsche 911Speedster\n\n5.95 1994 McLaren F1\n\n6.00 2011 LamborghiniAventador S\n\n6.00 1992 Subaru SVX\n\n6.06 2003 Opel Astra CoupeTurbo\n\n6.08 2008 Nissan GT-R\n\n6.13 1991 Acura NSX\n\n6.15 1989 Suzuki Swift GT\n\n6.17 1995 Lamborghini Diablo\n\n6.19 1969 Porsche 914\n\n6.2 2012 Tesla Model S\n\n6.24 2004 Toyota Prius\n\n6.27 1986 Porsche 911Carrera\n\n6.27 1992 Chevrolet Corvette\n\n6.35 1999 Lotus Elise\n\n6.77 1995 BMW M3\n\n6.79 1993 Corolla DX\n\n6.81 1989 Subaru Legacy\n\n6.96 1988 Porsche 944 S\n\n7.02 1992 BMW 325 I\n\n7.10 1978 Saab 900\n\n7.13 2007 SSC Ultimate Aero\n\n7.31 2015 Mazda3\n\n7.48 1993 Chevrolet CamaroZ28\n\n7.57 1992 Toyota Camry\n\n8.70 1990 Volvo 740 Turbo\n\n8.71 1991 Buick LeSabreLimited\n\n9.54 1992 Chevrolet CapriceWagon\n\n10.7 1992 Chevrolet S-10Blazer\n\n11.63 1991 Jeep Cherokee\n\n13.10 1990 Range RoverClassic\n\n13.76 1994 Toyota T100 SR54x4\n\n14.52 1994 Toyota LandCruiser\n\n17.43 1992 Land RoverDiscovery\n\n18.03 1992 Land RoverDefender 90\n\n18.06 1993 Hummer H1\n\n20.24 1993 Land RoverDefender 110\n\n26.32 2006 Hummer H2\n\nDownforce describes the downward pressure created by the aerodynamic characteristics of a car that allows it to travel faster through a corner by holding the car to the track or road surface.

capable of being powered. 8×8 (also, eight-wheel drive and 8WD) Reflecting four axles with both wheels on each capable of being powered.\n\nVehicles may be either part-time all-wheel drive or full-time:\n\nOn-demand (also, part-time) One axle is permanently connected to the drive, the other is being connected as needed\n\nFull-time (also, permanent) All axles are permanently connected, with or without a differential.\n\n1 Usage of the terminology 2 Characteristics 3 See also\n\n4 References\n\nToday, the designation AWD is becoming narrowed, particularly in North America, to apply to vehicles with drive train systems that have permanent drive and usually include a differential between the front and rear drive shafts. However, the designations AWD[1] and all-wheel drive[2] long predated the trend, with Associated Equipment Company (AEC) building AWD trucks in conjunction with FWD (UK) in 1929, and General Motors manufacturing a line as \"all-wheel drive\" as early as the late 1930s. This distinction in terminology is not generally used outside North America.\n\nThe Jeep Wrangler is a 4×4 four-wheel drive vehicle equipped with a low-range gearbox, which provides the driver with a selection between low range or high range gearing\n\nHayes WHDX 70-170 6×6 tractor\n\nThe 8×8 tractor unit of the HETS heavy equipment transport system\n\nContents\n\nUsage of the terminology\n\nCharacteristics\n\nWhen tire grip is good during road driving, a differential is used between the axles to avoid driveline windup. This is not required of- road, as the limited grip allows the tires to slip relative to each other. All-wheel drive vehicles designed for extensive off-road use may not have such a differential, and so they suffer from wind-up when used on-road.[3] Selectable 4WD also avoids this problem and requires only a simple dog clutch in the transfer case, rather than a differential. For this reason, most early off-road vehicles used that system; e.g., Jeep, Land Rover.\n\nAs vehicles became more sophisticated and tires gave better winter performance in the 1960s there was an interest in giving the benefits of all-wheel drive to conventional cars; not for off-road use but for winter use in snow or on wet roads. Esoteric vehicles such as the high-powered Jensen FF followed by the AMC Eagle, Subaru Leone and Audi Quattro series were the first to offer all-wheel drive in a high-speed road-based car. These, particularly the Quattro, would extensively develop this drivetrain with the use of viscous couplings and differentials to provide a safe and drivable car. The first off-road / on-road hybrids such as the Range Rover also chose the permanent all wheel drive system rather than manual selection.\n\nSelectable 4WD has both axles rigidly coupled together, which has some advantages in very poor off-road conditions. To gain the same advantage in a permanent AWD system with a differential, the differential can be locked manually with a differential lock. As this control is frequently misunderstood and mis-used, which can then cause damage due to wind-up, they have tended to be replaced by automatic locking through the viscous couplers.\n\nFront-wheel drive Rear-wheel drive All-terrain vehicle\n\nTwo-wheel drive\n\nH-drive\n\nFour Wheel Drive or FWD, one of the first companies, from 1909, to build four-wheel drive vehicles.\n\n1.
